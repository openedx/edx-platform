* In certain situations, PDF files in the course were saved with the wrong content type.  PDF files are now always stored with the content type ``application/pdf``. (STUD-878)

* The **Files & Uploads** page has been updated so that you can sort files on the page by file name or the date the file was uploaded to the course. (STUD-995)

  For more information, see the `Add Files to a Course`_. 

* The default **Course Start Date** for new courses is now **01/01/2030 GMT**.  This is to ensure that your course does not start before you intend it to. You must change the course start date to the date you want students to begin using the course. (STUD-1072)

  For more information, see the `The Course Start Date`_. 

* For new courses, sections and subsections now have a default release date of **January 1, 2030**. In this case, you must adjust the release date to the day you want students to be able to view the content. (STUD-1072)
   
  For more information, see the `Release Dates`_.
