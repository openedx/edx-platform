edX Documentation
**************************

You can access the public `edX roadmap`_ for
details about the currently planned product direction.

The following documentation is available:

* `Building and Running an edX Course`_ 

  You can also download the guide as a PDF from the edX Studio user interface.

  Recent changes include:
  
  * `Set the Advertised Start Date`_
  * `Full Screen Image`_


* `edX Research Guide`_


* `edX Developer's Guide`_

* The improved layout of components in a unit page now includes visual separation of the header, making clear that the display name for each component is not rendered to students.

* The new Full Screen Image tool allows students to enlarge an image, so they can see all the detail in context. You can create a full screen image with a new HTML component template. For more information, see the `Full Screen Image`_ documentation.

* If you do not change the default course start date (01/01/2030), and the advertised_start policy value is null, then the student dashboard does not now list a start date for the course. Students just see that the course has not yet started. For more information, see the `Set the Advertised Start Date`_ documentation.

===========================
Accessibility Improvements
===========================

* Unnecessary section tags were removed from the student's view of the courseware, so they are no longer announced by screen readers.

* Extraneous title blocks were removed from breadcrumbs, so they are no longer read by screen readers.

* In the student Progress tab, ordered list tags (<ol>) were replaced with <div> tags, to improve how screen readers interpret the screen.

* IDs were added to parts of the course navigation where they were missing, making it easier to skip parts of the course when using a screen reader.

* Updates to unit pages now make navigation more accessible to screen readers.

* Modal dialog boxes and script templates are now hidden from screen readers. 

* Mathjax messages that are specific to Internet Explorer are no longer shown when students are using a different browser.

* Alt text was added to the course footer logo.

* The character set meta tag was added to the main course template.

* The DOCTYPE declaration was added to the top of the main course template.
