The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of
October 7, 2014. See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.

****************************************
edX Release Announcements Mailing List
****************************************

These edX Course Staff Release Notes are always available and are updated with
each release of the edX Platform on `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_.

You can also sign up for the `edX Release Announcements mailing list`_ to get
an email message when we update the edX Course Staff Release Notes.


*******************************
edX Learning Management System
*******************************

* The private discussion cohorts feature has been released! When this optional feature is enabled for a course, the course team defines smaller communities of students within the larger, course-wide community. This feature allows course teams to divide students into cohort groups using either distinctive group characteristics or automated, random assignments. When the
  cohorts feature is enabled for a course, most discussion topics are divided so
  that students can only read and contribute to posts made by other members of
  the same cohort. However, course teams can open some discussions so that all
  students can read and contribute to the discussion. Additionally, if the
  cohorts feature is enabled for the course, the CSV file that contains student
  profile data now includes a **Cohort** column.

  We recommend that you implement cohorts in courses that are not yet released.
  Issues may arise if you enable the cohorts feature in a running course.

  For more information, see `Cohorts`_.

* In the Instructor Dashboard, downloading student profile data is now a
  background task. You can leave the **Data Download** page after you
  begin downloading students' profile information and return when the download
  is complete. Additionally, the **Download profile information as a CSV**
  button and the **List enrolled students' profile information** button have
  been moved to the **Reports** section of the **Data Download** page. (TNL-453)

* Course discussions have several new features:

  * Students can now change the topic of a post after they post it. Discussion administrators, moderators, and community TAs can edit the topic for any post.

  * Users no longer have the option to add comments to closed threads. (TNL-150)

  * When a user selects a topic or subtopic for a post, a link to the unit that contains
    that discussion topic or subtopic in the body of the course now appears immediately when the
    post is created. (TNL-404)

  * Users who have the discussion admin role can now remove their
    own or other users' discussion admin status. (TNL-315)

  * For some users, a list of posts did not appear in the left sidebar when
    the user clicked **Posts I'm Following**. This bug has been fixed. (TNL-469)

  * Pinned posts now always appear at the top of the list of posts, regardless
    of the way that the posts are sorted. (TNL-90)

* In some browsers, if a student clicked a word in a transcript to move to that
  point in the video, the video began playing from the correct point, but the
  transcript stopped following along with the video. This bug has been fixed.

* In HTML text components, the default font now appears as an option in the
  **Font** menu. (TNL-147)

* When a Problem component contained a custom JavaScript display and grading (JS
  Input) problem and at least one other problem, the JS Input problem was scored
  incorrectly. The additional problem in the component could be any type of
  problem. These problems are now scored correctly. (TNL-269)

* When you exported a course, the setting for **Video Download Allowed** in a
  Video component changed from **False** to **True** in the exported course.
  This bug has been fixed. (TNL-324)

  students and to let us know what else you'd like the guide to cover.
