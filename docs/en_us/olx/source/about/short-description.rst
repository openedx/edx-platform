Optionally, you can define a short description for your course.

Students see the short description when they move their cursors over the course
image in the catalog.

*********************************************
Create the Short Description File
*********************************************

You create an HTML file called ``short_description.html`` in the ``overview``
directory.

The short description is limited to 150 characters.

Within that limit, you can add any text and HTML markup to the short
description file within that.
