What is Open Learning XML?
###########################

Open Learning XML (OLX) is the XML-based standard used to build courses for the
edX Platform.

With OLX, you can:

* Move content between instances of Open edX.
* Create course content outside of edX Studio, including by conversion from
  other content formats.
* Ensure content remains free of proprietary encoding and allow portability.

OLX is based on XML. XML, or Extensible Markup Language, is a set of rules
for creating documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-
readable.

To work with OLX, you should have a strong understanding of XML. This
document presumes you understand XML and can use tools to create and edit XML
files.

For a primer on XML, see the `Wikipedia XML entry`_ .
