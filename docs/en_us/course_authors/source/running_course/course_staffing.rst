Staffing
##########################

You can designate a team of people to help you run your course. Two roles are available to give your team members access to different options for working with students, grades, and other course staff.

* Staff members

* Instructors

.. **Question**: how does this team, set up on the Instructor Dashboard, differ from the "Course Team Members" that you add in Studio (Settings > Course Team)?

You can also designate people to help you beta test a course and to moderate and manage discussions. Beta testers and discussion administrators must be enrolled in your course, but you do not need to give them a staff role. For more information, see :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`. 

.. insert ":ref:`Beta_Testing` and " above after "see"

You use these roles to define the team that helps you run your course. To help you develop a course in Studio, you set up a team in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Add Course Team Members`.

**********************
Staff roles
**********************

To provide access to features on the LMS Instructor Dashboard you assign the Course Staff role or the Instructor role.

**Course Staff** can: 

* View the course before the Course Start Date. 

* Enroll and unenroll students.

* Access student grades.

* Reset student attempts to answer a question correctly.

* See course HTML errors.

* Send email messages to course participants.

**Instructors** have access to all of the same options for running the course as the course staff. They can also:

* Add and remove course staff.

* Add and remove other instructors.

* Add and remove beta testers.

* Add and remove discussion forum admins, moderators, and community TAs.

.. 12 Feb 14 Sarina: This all sounds right but there are other tasks (rescoring, etc) not mentioned. Probably worth nailing down what tasks can and cannot be done by a course staff.
