Staffing
##########################

You can designate a team of people to help you run your course. Two roles are
available to give your administrative team members access to different options
for working with students, grades, and other members of the staff.

* Course Staff

* Instructors

.. **Question**: how does this team, set up on the Instructor Dashboard, differ from the "Course Team Members" that you add in Studio (Settings > Course Team)?

The administrative team that helps you run your course in the LMS can include
some, all, or none of the people who help you set up the course in Studio. You
assign these administrative roles in the LMS, separately from the roles you
assign in Studio. For more information on setting up a team in Studio, see
:ref:`Add Course Team Members`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course and to
moderate and manage its discussions by assigning other LMS roles. The beta
testers and discussion administrators must be enrolled in your course, but
they do not need to have the Course Staff or Instructors role or a Studio
role. For more information, see :ref:`Beta_Testing` and
:ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

****************************
Administrative Team Roles
****************************

To provide access to features on the LMS Instructor Dashboard you assign the
Course Staff role or the Instructors role.

**Course Staff** can: 

* View the course before the Course Start Date. 

* Enroll and unenroll students.

* Access student grades.

* Reset student attempts to answer a question correctly.

* See course HTML errors.

* Send email messages to course participants.

**Instructors** have access to all of the same options for running the course as the course staff. They can also:

* Add and remove Course Staff.

* Add and remove other Instructors.

* Add and remove Beta Testers.

* Add and remove Discussion Admins, Discussion Moderators, and Discussion
  Community TAs.

.. 12 Feb 14 Sarina: This all sounds right but there are other tasks (rescoring, etc) not mentioned. Probably worth nailing down what tasks can and cannot be done by a course staff.

**********************
