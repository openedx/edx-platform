Student Guide to Certificates
##############################

Nearly every course on edx.org offers a certificate when you complete a course
successfully. The certificate includes your name, the name of the course, the
edX partner university that created the course, and the names of one or more
members of the course team. The certificate also lists a URL that viewers can
use to verify the authenticity of the certificate.

Because edX courses are not credit-bearing courses, the certificate doesn't
include a grade or specify the number of credit hours that the course might earn
in a university. Additionally, transcripts are not available for edX course
work.

.. note:: Your certificate lists the full name that appears on your dashboard. 
  Before your course ends, make sure that the name on your dashboard is correct. 
  To change your full name, go to your dashboard, and then click **edit** under 
  **Full Name** in the left pane.

****************************
Selecting a Certificate Type
****************************

Three types of certificates may be available for courses on edx.org: honor code,
verified, and XSeries. You select the certificate type you want when you
register for a course.

Honor code and verified certificates show that you've completed a single honor
code or verified course. An XSeries certificate shows that you've completed a
series of courses, known as an XSeries.

The type of certificate appears in a color-coded tag under the course image on
your dashboard:

.. note:: A very small number of courses do not offer certificates. These courses 
  have the same rigorous material as other edX courses. If you want evidence that 
  you completed the course, you can print a copy of the **Progress** page in the course.


=========================
Honor Code Certificates
=========================

Honor code certificates are free of charge to all students and are available for
all except a few specific courses. When you audit a course, or you take a course
that doesn't offer verified certificates, you'll automatically receive an honor
code certificate if you meet the requirements to pass the course.

=========================
Verified Certificates
=========================

A verified certificate shows not only that you successfully completed your edX
course, but also that you've verified your identity by using a webcam and an
official ID from your country or region. You may want to work toward a verified
certificate if you plan to use your course for job applications, promotions, or
school applications.

Verified certificates are available for select courses. If a course offers
verified certificates, you'll see a "Verified" badge on the course image in the
list of courses on edx.org:

Verified certificates are available for a fee that varies by course. The fee
helps support edX. If you want to help support edX, you can choose to pay more
than the minimum required fee. For more information about the fee for a
particular course, see the About page for that course.

When you register for a verified course, you'll use a webcam to submit a photo
of yourself and of an official ID to edX's secure authorization service. We
encrypt your photos and use the highest levels of security available to protect
your data. During the course, you may be asked to use the same method to re-
verify your identity periodically. If your computer doesn't have a webcam, you
must register for the verified certificate on a computer that has a webcam.

.. For more information about registering for a verified certificate and paying
.. the fee, see :ref:`SFD_registration`. (this topic not written yet)

For a list of all courses that offer verified
certificates, see the `edX course catalog <https://www.edx.org/course-
list/allschools/verified/allcourses>`_.

If you have a question or an issue with billing for a verified certificate,
contact us at `billing@edx.org <mailto://billing@edx.org>`_. Include your order
number, but please **do not include your credit card information**.

=========================
XSeries Certificates
=========================

XSeries certificates show that you've successfully earned a verified certificate
for each course in a series of courses that make up an XSeries.

****************************
Changing a Certificate Type
****************************

You may register for one type of certificate but later decide that you want a
different type of certificate. For example, you may register for an honor code
certificate, but you might later want to change to a verified certificate. You
can change the certificate type until registration for verified certificates
ends for your course, usually two or more weeks after the course starts.

* To upgrade to a verified certificate, go to your dashboard, and then click
  **Challenge Yourself!** under the name of your course. You'll then follow the
  onscreen instructions to register for a verified certificate.

  If registration for verified certificates has closed, you can't change your
  certificate type. Registration for verified certificates typically closes two
  weeks after the course has started, or after at least one assignment due date
  has passed.

* To change from a verified certificate to an honor code certificate, go to your
  dashboard, and then click **Unregister** under the name of your course. The
  edX support team will contact you with information about a refund. You must
  change to an honor code certificate before verified certificate registration
  closes for your course if you want to receive a refund.

  If you don't see the **Unregister** button, registration for verified
  certificates has closed. Registration for verified certificates typically
  closes two weeks after the course has started, or after at least one
  assignment due date has passed. 

If you have questions about changing your certificate type, you can contact the
edX support team at `technical@edx.org <mailto://technical@edx.org>`_. 

*************************
Receiving a Certificate
*************************

Certificates are distributed shortly after a course ends--usually within two
weeks. After the course ends, you'll see the following message under the course
name on your dashboard:

``Final course details are being wrapped up at this time. Your final standing
will be available shortly.``

When your certificate is ready, your dashboard will show you your final grade
for the class as well as a link to your certificate.

If you want a paper copy of your certificate, you can click **Download Your Certificate (PDF)** to download and print the certificate from your dashboard.

.. note:: Your certificate lists the full name that appears on your dashboard. 
  Before your course ends, make sure that the name on your dashboard is correct. 
  To change your full name, go to your dashboard, and then click **edit** under 
  **Full Name** in the left pane.

=============================================
Receiving Certificates for Self-Paced Courses
=============================================

While most edX courses have specific start and end dates, a few courses are
self-paced. You can start these courses anytime and work through the courseware
at your own pace.

Receiving a certificate for a self-paced course is similar to receiving a
certificate for a regular course. After you've completed all course assignments
and the final exam (if applicable), a certificate is generated automatically.
You don't have to complete any additional steps to obtain your certificate.

Be aware, however, that different self-paced courses issue certificates at
different intervals. Some courses issue certificates once a month, and others issue
certificates less frequently. For more information about your course's specific
certificate schedule, see the About page or the **Course Info** tab for your
course.
