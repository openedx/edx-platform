Add a Post
***************************

Every post in the course discussions has an associated topic. Before you add a
post, look through the topics. When you add your post to the most appropriate
topic, others with the same interest can find, read, and respond to it more
easily.

Topics can be *content-specific* or *course-wide*. 

To make sure that other students and the course team can find and respond to
your post, try to select the correct type for your post: either question or
discussion.

* A *question* post raises an issue so that the course staff and community can
  provide answers.

* A *discussion* post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and
  reflections, and inviting community participation.

If you have any difficulty deciding which type of post you want to add, think
about whether you want to get concrete information (a question) or start an
open-ended conversation (a discussion).

You can add a post from inside the course, or you can add a post from the **Discussion** page.

===============================
Add a Post inside the Course
===============================

If you come to a discussion as you work through the units in your course, or if
you know where in the course a particular discussion originates, you can add a
post for that discussion right from the unit in your course. This only applies
to content-specific discussions.

#. Click **Courseware**.

#. Open the unit in the course that includes the discussion topic that you want
   to add to.

#. Click **Show Discussion** to read what others have already contributed to the
   conversation.

   You can scroll through the posts that have already been added: the title and
   the first sentence or two of each post appear. To read an entire post, view
   the responses to it, and see any comments, click **Expand discussion**.
  
4. Click **New Post** to add a post.

   to see options for formatting the text and for adding links or images.

students won't be able to see your username, but course staff can find this
information if necessary.
