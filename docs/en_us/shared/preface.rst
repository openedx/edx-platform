Preface
############

Course teams, researchers, developers, students: the edX community includes
groups with a range of reasons for using the platform and objectives to
accomplish. To help members of each group learn about what edX offers, reach
goals, and solve problems, edX provides a variety of information resources.

To help you find what you need, browse the edX offerings in these categories:

* :ref:`Resources for Course Teams`
* :ref:`Resources for Researchers`
* :ref:`Resources for Developers`
* :ref:`Resources for Students`

All members of the edX community are encouraged to make use of any of the
resources described in this preface.

In a Course
------------

All edX courses have a discussion forum where you can ask questions and
interact with other students and with the course team: click **Discussion**.
Many courses also offer a wiki for additional resources and materials: click
**Wiki**.

Other resources may also be available, such as a course-specific facebook page
or twitter feed or opportunites for Google hangouts. Be sure to check the
**Course Info** page for your course as well as the **Discussion** and **Wiki**
pages.

From time to time, the course team may send email messages to all students.
While you can opt out of these messages, doing so means that you may miss
important or time-sensitive information. To change your preferences for course
email, click **edX** or **edX edge** at the top of any page. On your dashboard
of current courses, locate the course and then click **Email Settings**.

From edX
---------

To help you get started with the edX learning experience, edX offers a course

maintains a list of frequently_ asked questions and answers.

If you still have questions or suggestions, you can get help from the edX
support team: click **Contact** at the bottom of any edX web page or send an
email message to info@edx.org.
