**************************
Resources for Learners
**************************

==============
Documentation
==============

The `EdX Learner's Guide`_ and the `Open edX Learner's Guide`_ are available
on the docs.edx.org web page. Because learners are currently only guided to
this resource through the course, we encourage course teams to provide
learners with links to these guides as needed in course updates or discussions.

==============
In a Course
==============

All edX courses have a discussion forum where you can ask questions and
interact with other students and with the course team: select **Discussion**.
Many courses also offer a wiki for additional resources and materials: select
**Wiki**.

Other resources might also be available, such as a course-specific Facebook
page or Twitter feed. Be sure to check the **Home** page for your course as
well as the **Discussion** and **Wiki** pages.

From time to time, the course team might send email messages to all students.
While you can opt out of these messages, doing so means that you can miss
important or time-sensitive information. To change your preferences for course
email, select **edX** or **edX edge** at the top of any page. On your dashboard
of current courses, locate the course and then select **Email Settings**.

==========
From edX
