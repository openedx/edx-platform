Resources for Students
**************************

Documentation
-------------

The `edX Guide for Students`_ is available on the docs.edx.org web page.
Because students are not currently guided to this resource through the
courseware, we encourage course staff to provide links to students as needed
in course updates or discussions.

In a Course
------------

All edX courses have a discussion forum where you can ask questions and
interact with other students and with the course team: click **Discussion**.
Many courses also offer a wiki for additional resources and materials: click
**Wiki**.

Other resources might also be available, such as a course-specific Facebook
page or Twitter feed, or opportunities for Google Hangouts. Be sure to check
the **Course Info** page for your course as well as the **Discussion** and
**Wiki** pages.

From time to time, the course team might send email messages to all students.
While you can opt out of these messages, doing so means that you can miss
important or time-sensitive information. To change your preferences for course
email, click **edX** or **edX edge** at the top of any page. On your dashboard
of current courses, locate the course and then click **Email Settings**.
