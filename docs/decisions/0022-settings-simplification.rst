Context
*******

OEP-45 declares that sites will configure each IDA's (indepently-deployable
application's) Django settings with an ``<APPNAME>_CFG`` yaml file, parsed and
loaded by a single upstream-provided ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``. this contrasts
with the django convention, which is that sites override Django settings using
a their own ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``. The rationale is that all Open edX
customization can be reasonably specified in YAML; therefore, it is
operationally safer to avoid using a custom ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``, and it
is operationally desirable for all operation modes to execute the same Python
module for configuration. This was `briefly discussed in the oep-45 review
<https://github.com/openedx/open-edx-proposals/pull/143#discussion_r411180111>`_.

For example, in theory, the upstream production LMS config might be named
``lms/settings/settings.py`` and work like this:

* import ``lms/settings/required.py``, which declares settings that must be
  overridden.
* import ``lms/settings/defaults.py``, which defines reasonable defaults for
  all other settings.
* load ``/openedx/config/lms.yml``, which should override every setting
  declared in required.py and override some settings defined in defaults.py.
* apply some minimal merging and/or conditional logic to handle yaml values
  which are not simple overrides (e.g., ``FEATURES``, which needs to be
  merged).

The upstream production CMS config would exist in parallel.

However, as of Sumac, we do not know of any site other than edx.org that
successfully uses only YAML files for configuration. Furthermore,
upstream-provided ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` which loads these yaml files
(``lms/envs/production.py``) is not simple: it declares defaults, imports from
other Django settings modules, sets more defaults, handles dozens of special
cases, and has a special Open-edX-specific "derived settings" mechanism to
handle settings that depend on other settings.

Tutor does provide YAML files, but *it also has custom production and
development settings files*! The result is that we have multiple layers of
indirection between edx-platform's common base settings, and the Django
settings rendered into the actual community-supported Open edX distribution
(Tutor). Specifically, production edx-platform configuration currently works
like this:

* ``lms/envs/tutor/production.py``...

  * is generated by Tutor from the template
    ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/settings/lms/production.py``,

    * which derives
      ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/settings/partials/common_lms.py``,

      * which derives
        ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/settings/partials/common_all.py``;

    * and uses templates vars from Tutor configuration (``config.yml``),

    * and invokes hooks from any enable Tutor plugins;

  * it imports ``lms/envs/production.py``,

    * which imports ``lms/envs/common.py``,

      * which sets production-inappropriate defaults;

    * it sets more defaults, some of them edX.org-specific;

    * it loads ``/openedx/config/lms.yml``...

      * which is generated by Tutor from template
        ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/config/lms.env.yml``

        * which derives
          ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/config/partials/auth.yml``;

    * it reverts some of ``lms.yml`` with new "defaults";

    * and it uses certain values ``/openedx/config/lms.yml`` to conditionally
      override more settings and update certain dictionary settings, in a way
      which is not documented.

* ``cms/envs/tutor/production.py``...

  * is generated by Tutor from the template
    ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/settings/cms/production.py``,

    * which derives
      ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/settings/partials/common_cms.py``,

      * which derives
        ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/settings/partials/common_all.py``;

    * and uses templates vars from Tutor configuration (``config.yml``),

    * and invokes hooks from any enable Tutor plugins;

  * it imports ``cms/envs/production.py``,

    * it imports ``cms/envs/common.py``, which sets production-inappropriate
      defaults,

      * and which imports ``lms/envs/common.py``, which also sets
        production-inappropriate defaults;

    * it sets more defaults, some of the edX.org-specific;

    * it loads ``/openedx/config/cms.yml``...

      * which is generated by Tutor from template
        ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/config/cms.env.yml``

        * which derives
          ``tutor/templates/apps/openedx/config/partials/auth.yml``;

    * it reverts some of ``/openedx/config/cms.yml`` with new "defaults";

    * and it uses certain values ``/openedx/config/cms.yml`` to conditionally
      override more settings and update certain dictionary settings, in a way
      which is not documented.

This is very difficult to reason about. Configuration complexity is frequently
cited as a chief area of pain for Open edX developers and operators.
Discussions in the Named Release Planning and Build-Test-Release Working Groups
frequently are encumbered with confusion and uncertainty of what the default
settings are in edx-platform, how they differ from Tutor's default settings,
what settings can be overriden, and how to do so. Only a minority of developers
and operators fully understand the configuration logic described above
end-to-end; even for those that do, following this override chain for any given
Django setting is time-consuming and error-prone. CAT-1 bugs and high-severity
security vulnerabilities have arisen due to misunderstanding of how
edx-platform Django settings are rendered.

Developers are frequently instructed that if they need to override a Django
setting, the preferred way to do so is to "make a Tutor plugin". This is a
large amount of prior knowledge, boilerplate, and indirection, all required
to simply do something which Django provides out-of-the-box via a custom
``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``.

Finally, it is worth nothing that all the complexity and toil exists alongside
other edx-platform configuration methods, such as Waffle, configuration models,
site configuration, XBlock configuration, and entry points. Those configuration
pathways are outside of the scope of this ADR, but are mentioned to demonstrate
the distressing level of complexity that developers and operators face when
working with the platform.

Decision & Consequences
***********************

Overview
========

We orient edx-platform towards using standard Django settings configuration
patterns. Specifically, we will make it easy for operators to override settings
by supplying a custom ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``.

Moving towards this goals will need to be an iterative and careful process,
and it's likely that some aspects of the target structure or plan (described
below) will need to updated along the way. Nonetheless, once it becomes clear
that we are landing on a solid settings structure for edx-platform, we'll
propose an OEP-45 update to generalize the structure to all deployable Open edX
Django applications.

Finally, based on what we learn throughout this process, our OEP-45 propsal
will either recommend to:

1. Drop support for the ``<APP>_CFG`` YAML files, or

2. Simplify the ``<APP>_CFG`` YAML schema, document it, and clarify that it
   is an optional alternative to ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` rather than the
   required/preferred configuration method.

Target settings structure for edx-platform
==========================================

* ``openedx/envs/common.py``: Define as much shared configuration between LMS
  and CMS as possible, including: (a) where possible, annotated definitions of
  edx-platform-specific settings with *reasonable, production-ready* defaults;
  (b) otherwise, annotated definitions of edx-platform-specific settings (like
  secrets) with *obviously-wrong* defaults, ensuring they aren't used in
  production; and (c) un-annotated reasonable production-ready overrides of
  third-party settings. When a particular setting's default should depend on
  the *final* value of another setting, the former should be assigned to a
  ``Derived(...)`` value, where ``...`` is a computation based on the latter.

  * ``lms/envs/common.py``: Extend ``openedx/envs/common.py`` to create, as
    much as possible, a production-ready settings file for the LMS. These
    extension may include: (a) annotated definitions of LMS-specific settings
    with production-ready defaults; (b) annotated definitions of LMS-specific
    settings with obviously-wrong defaults; (c) un-annotated LMS-specific
    overrides of settings defined in ``openedx/envs/common.py``; and (d)
    un-annotated overrides of third-party settings. Again, ``Derived`` settings
    can be used as appropriate. This will be the default settings file for
    running LMS management commands, although tools can override this (as
    usual) by specifying a ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``.

    * ``lms/envs/test.py``: Override LMS settings for unit tests. Should work
      in a local venv as well as in CI. Needs to invoke ``derive_settings`` in
      order to render all previously-defined ``Derived`` settings.

    * ``<third_party_repo>/lms_prod.py`` (example path): In order to
      deploy the LMS, third-party providers (like edx.org) and tools (like
      Tutor) will need to separately maintain their own custom settings module
      derived from ``lms/envs/common.py``, and point their
      ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable at this module. It is
      important that this module both (i) replaces the obviously-wrong settings
      with appropriate production settings, and (ii) invokes
      ``derive_settings`` to render all previously-defined ``Derived`` settings.

    * ``lms/envs/yaml.py`` (only if we decide to retain YAML support):
      An upstream-maintained alternative to
      ``<third_party_repo>/lms_repo.py>``. Loads overrides from a YAML file at
      ``LMS_CFG``, plus some well-defined special handling for mergable values
      like ``FEATURES``. This is adapted from and replaces
      lms/envs/production.py. It will invoke ``derive_settings``.

    * ``lms/envs/dev.py``: Override LMS settings so that it can run
      "bare metal" directly on a developer's local machine using debug-friendly
      settings. Will use ``local.openedx.io`` (which resolves to 127.0.0.1) as
      a base domain, which should be suitable for third-party tools as well. It
      will invoke ``derive_settings``.

      * ``<third_party_repo>/lms_dev.py`` (example path): In order to
        run the LMS, third-party tools (like Tutor, and 2U's devstack) will
        need to separately maintain their own custom settings module derived
        from ``lms/envs/dev.py``, and point their
        ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable at this module.

  * ``cms/envs/common.py``

    * ``cms/envs/test.py``

    * ``<third_party_repo>/cms_prod.py`` (example path)

    * ``cms/envs/yaml.py`` (only if we decide to retain YAML support)

    * ``cms/envs/dev.py``

      * ``<third_party_repo>/cms_dev.py`` (example path)

Plan of action
==============

These steps are non-breaking unless noted.

* Introduce a dump_settings management command so that we can more easily
  validate changes (or lack thereof) to the terminal edx-platform settings
  modules.

* Improve edx-platform's API for
  deriving settings, as we are about to depend on it significantly more than we
  currently do. This is a potentially BREAKING CHANGE to any third-party
  settings files which imported from ``openedx.core.lib.derived``.

* Remove redundant overrides in (cms,lms)/envs/production.py. Use Derived
  settings defaults to further simplify the module without changing its output.

* Create openedx/envs/common.py, ensuring that toggle and setting annotations
  are loaded from it. Move settings which are shared between
  (cms,lms)/envs/common.py into openedx/envs/common.py. This may be iteratively
  done across multiple PRs.

* Find the best production-ready defaults between both
  (lms,cms)/envs/production.py and Tutor's production.pys, and "bubble" them up
  to (openedx,cms,lms)/common.py. Keep (lms,cms)/envs/production.py unchanged
  through this process. This is a BREAKING CHANGE for any operator that derives
  from (lms,cms)/envs/common.py directly. Most operators derive from
  (lms,cms)/envs/production.py, so we do not expect this to affect many sites,
  if any.

* Develop (cms,lms)/envs/dev based off of (cms,lms)/envs/common.py.
  Iterate until we can run "bare metal" development server for LMS and CMS
  using these settings.

* Deprecate and remove (cms,lms)/envs/devstack.py. This is a BREAKING CHANGE to
  third-party development tools (like Tutor and 2U's devstack), as they will
  now either need to maintain local copies of these modules, or "rebase"
  themselves onto (lms,cms)/envs/dev.py.

* Propose and, if accepted, implement an update to OEP-45 (Configuring and
  Operating Open edX). `Progress on this update is tracked here`_. As mentioned
  in the Decision section, this update will either:

  1. Revoke the OEP-45 sections regarding YAML. Deprecate and remove
     (cms,lms)/envs/production.py. This is a BREAKING CHANGE for tools and
     providers that use these settings modules, as they will either need to
     maintain local copies of these modules, or "rebase" their internal
     settings modules onto (cms,lms)/envs/common.py. Update operator
     documenation as needed.

  2. Update OEP-45 to clarify that YAML configuration is
     optional. Operators can opt out of YAML by deriving directly from
     (cms,lms)/envs/common.py, or they can opt into YAML by using
     (cms,lms)/envs/yaml.py. Document a simplified YAML schema in OEP-45.
     There will be several well-communicated BREAKING CHANGES in YAML behavior
     in order to achieve the simplified schema. Furthermore, the rename of
     (cms,lms)/envs/production.py to (cms,lms)/envs/yaml.py will be a BREAKING
     CHANGE.

* Create tickets to achieve a similar OEP-45-compliant settings structure in
  any IDAs (independently-deployable applications) which exist in the openedx
  GitHub organization, such as the Credentials service.

Alternatives Considered
***********************

One alternative settings structure
----------------------------------

Here is an alternate structure would de-dupe any shared LMS/CMS dev & test
logic by creating more shared modules within openedx/envs folder. Although
DRYer, this structure would increase the total number of edx-platform files and
potentially encourage more LMS-CMS coupling. So, will not pursue this
structure, but will keep it in mind as an alternative if we enounter
difficulties with the plan laid out in this ADR.

* ``openedx/envs/common.py``

  * ``lms/envs/prod.py``

    * ``$THIRD_PARTY/lms/production.py``

  * ``cms/envs/prod.py``

    * ``$THIRD_PARTY/cms/production.py``

  * ``openedx/envs/test.py``

    * ``lms/envs/test.py``
