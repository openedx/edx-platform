        **Parameters**:

            * all_blocks: (boolean) Provide a value of "true" to return all
              blocks. Returns all blocks only if the requesting user has course
              staff permissions. Blocks that are visible only to specific learners
              (for example, based on group membership or randomized content) are
              all included. If all_blocks is not specified, you must specify the
              username for the user whose course blocks are requested.

            * username: (string) Required, unless ``all_blocks`` is specified.
              Specify the username for the user whose course blocks are requested.
              A blank/empty username can be used to request the blocks accessible
              to anonymous users (for public courses). Only users with course staff
              permissions can specify other users' usernames. If a username is
              specified, results include blocks that are visible to that user,
              including those based on group or cohort membership or randomized
              content assigned to that user.

              Example: username=anjali
                       username=''
                       username

            * student_view_data: (list) Indicates for which block types to return
              student_view_data.

              Example: student_view_data=video

            * block_counts: (list) Indicates for which block types to return the
              aggregate count of the blocks.

              Example: block_counts=video,problem

            * requested_fields: (list) Indicates which additional fields to return
              for each block.  For a list of available fields see under `Response
              Values -> blocks`, below.

              The following fields are always returned: id, type, display_name

              Example: requested_fields=graded,format,student_view_multi_device

            * depth: (integer or all) Indicates how deep to traverse into the blocks
              hierarchy.  A value of all means the entire hierarchy.

              Default is 0

              Example: depth=all

            * nav_depth: (integer)

              WARNING: nav_depth is not supported, and may be removed at any time.

              Indicates how far deep to traverse into the
              course hierarchy before bundling all the descendants.

              Default is 3 since typical navigational views of the course show a
              maximum of chapter->sequential->vertical.

              Example: nav_depth=3

            * return_type (string) Indicates in what data type to return the
              blocks.

              Default is dict. Supported values are: dict, list

              Example: return_type=dict

            * block_types_filter: (list) Requested types of blocks used to filter the final result
              of returned blocks. Possible values include sequential, vertical, html, problem,
              video, and discussion.

              Example: block_types_filter=vertical,html

        **Response Values**

            The following fields are returned with a successful response.

            * root: The ID of the root node of the requested course block
              structure.

            * blocks: A dictionary or list, based on the value of the
              "return_type" parameter. Maps block usage IDs to a collection of
              information about each block. Each block contains the following
              fields.

              * id: (string) The usage ID of the block.

              * type: (string) The type of block. Possible values the names of any
                XBlock type in the system, including custom blocks. Examples are
                course, chapter, sequential, vertical, html, problem, video, and
                discussion.

              * display_name: (string) The display name of the block.

              * children: (list) If the block has child blocks, a list of IDs of
                the child blocks.  Returned only if "children" is included in the
                "requested_fields" parameter.

              * completion: (float or None) The level of completion of the block.
                Its value can vary between 0.0 and 1.0 or be equal to None
                if block is not completable. Returned only if "completion"
                is included in the "requested_fields" parameter.

              * block_counts: (dict) For each block type specified in the
                block_counts parameter to the endpoint, the aggregate number of
                blocks of that type for this block and all of its descendants.

              * graded (boolean) Whether or not the block or any of its descendants
                is graded.  Returned only if "graded" is included in the
                "requested_fields" parameter.

              * format: (string) The assignment type of the block.  Possible values
                can be "Homework", "Lab", "Midterm Exam", and "Final Exam".
                Returned only if "format" is included in the "requested_fields"
                parameter.

              * student_view_data: (dict) The JSON data for this block.
                Returned only if the "student_view_data" input parameter contains
                this block's type.

              * student_view_url: (string) The URL to retrieve the HTML rendering
                of this block's student view.  The HTML could include CSS and
                Javascript code. This field can be used in combination with the
                student_view_multi_device field to decide whether to display this
                content to the user.

                This URL can be used as a fallback if the student_view_data for
                this block type is not supported by the client or the block.

              * student_view_multi_device: (boolean) Whether or not the HTML of
                the student view that is rendered at "student_view_url" supports
                responsive web layouts, touch-based inputs, and interactive state
                management for a variety of device sizes and types, including
                mobile and touch devices. Returned only if
                "student_view_multi_device" is included in the "requested_fields"

            * username: (string) Required, unless ``all_blocks`` is specified.
              Specify the username for the user whose course blocks are requested.
              A blank/empty username can be used to request the blocks accessible
              to anonymous users (for public courses). Only users with course staff
              permissions can specify other users' usernames. If a username is
              specified, results include blocks that are visible to that user,
              including those based on group or cohort membership or randomized
              content assigned to that user.

              Example: username=anjali
                       username=''
                       username

            * student_view_data: (list) Indicates for which block types to return
              student_view_data.

              Example: student_view_data=video

            * block_counts: (list) Indicates for which block types to return the
              aggregate count of the blocks.

              Example: block_counts=video,problem

            * requested_fields: (list) Indicates which additional fields to return
              for each block.  For a list of available fields see under `Response
              Values -> blocks`, below.

              The following fields are always returned: id, type, display_name

              Example: requested_fields=graded,format,student_view_multi_device

            * depth: (integer or all) Indicates how deep to traverse into the blocks
              hierarchy.  A value of all means the entire hierarchy.

              Default is 0

              Example: depth=all

            * nav_depth: (integer)

              WARNING: nav_depth is not supported, and may be removed at any time.

              Indicates how far deep to traverse into the
              course hierarchy before bundling all the descendants.

              Default is 3 since typical navigational views of the course show a
              maximum of chapter->sequential->vertical.

              Example: nav_depth=3

            * return_type (string) Indicates in what data type to return the
              blocks.

              Default is dict. Supported values are: dict, list

            * block_types_filter: (list) Requested types of blocks used to filter the final result
              of returned blocks. Possible values include sequential, vertical, html, problem,
              video, and discussion.

              Example: block_types_filter=vertical,html

        **Response Values**

            The following fields are returned with a successful response.

                discussion.

              * display_name: (string) The display name of the block.

              * children: (list) If the block has child blocks, a list of IDs of
                the child blocks.  Returned only if "children" is included in the
                "requested_fields" parameter.

              * completion: (float or None) The level of completion of the block.
                Its value can vary between 0.0 and 1.0 or be equal to None
                if block is not completable. Returned only if "completion"
                is included in the "requested_fields" parameter.

              * block_counts: (dict) For each block type specified in the
                block_counts parameter to the endpoint, the aggregate number of
                blocks of that type for this block and all of its descendants.

              * graded (boolean) Whether or not the block or any of its descendants
                is graded.  Returned only if "graded" is included in the
                "requested_fields" parameter.

              * student_view_url: (string) The URL to retrieve the HTML rendering
                of this block's student view.  The HTML could include CSS and
                Javascript code. This field can be used in combination with the
                student_view_multi_device field to decide whether to display this
                content to the user.

                This URL can be used as a fallback if the student_view_data for
                this block type is not supported by the client or the block.

              * student_view_multi_device: (boolean) Whether or not the HTML of
                the student view that is rendered at "student_view_url" supports

                xBlock on the web. This URL can be used as a further fallback
                if the student_view_url and the student_view_data fields are not
                supported. Will direct to either the "New" (micro-frontend) or
                "Legacy" (Django-template-rendered) frontend experience depending
                on which experience is active.

              * legacy_web_url: (string) Like `lms_web_url`, but always directs to
                the "Legacy" frontend experience. Should only be used for
                transitional purposes; will be removed as part of DEPR-109.

              * lti_url: The block URL for an LTI consumer. Returned only if the
                "ENABLE_LTI_PROVIDER" Django settign is set to "True".

        parameter. If the username does not match that of the currently logged in user, only

        As a result, a course team member can find out which of their own courses a particular
        learner is enrolled in.

        Only the Staff or Admin role (granted on the Django administrative console as the staff
        or instructor permission) in individual courses gives the requesting user access to
        enrollment data. Permissions granted at the organizational level do not give a user
        access to enrollment data for all of that organization's courses.

        Users who have the global staff permission can access all enrollment data for all
        courses.

            }

        **POST Parameters**

        A POST request can include the following parameters:

        * problem_location: A list of usage keys for the blocks to include in
          the report. If the location is a block that contains other blocks,
          (such as the course, section, subsection, or unit blocks) then all
          blocks under that block will be included in the report.
        * problem_types_filter: Optional. A comma-separated list of block types
          to include in the report. If set, only blocks of the specified types
          will be included in the report.

        To get data on all the poll and survey blocks in a course, you could
        POST the usage key of the course for `problem_location`, and
        "poll, survey" as the value for `problem_types_filter`.


        **Example Response:**
        If initiation is successful (or generation task is already running):
        ```json
        {
            "status": "The problem responses report is being created. ...",

        Get information about the courses that the currently signed in user is
            enrolled in.

            v1 differs from v0.5 version by returning ALL enrollments for
            a user rather than only the enrollments the user has access to (that haven't expired).
            An additional attribute "expiration" has been added to the response, which lists the date
            when access to the course will expire or null if it doesn't expire.

        **Example Request**

            GET /api/mobile/v1/users/{username}/course_enrollments/

            If the request for information about the user is successful, the
            request returns an HTTP 200 "OK" response.

      description: |-
        This endpoint exists to get an overview of each course-run enrollment
        that a user has for course-runs within a given program.
        Fields included are the title, upcoming due dates, etc.
        This API endpoint is intended for use with the
        [Program Learner Portal MFE](https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-learner-portal-programs).

        It is important to note that the set of enrollments that this endpoint returns
        is different than a user's set of *program-course-run enrollments*.
        Specifically, this endpoint may include course runs that are *within*
        the specified program but were not *enrolled in* via the specified program.

      description: |-
        This API is intended to be a server-to-server endpoint. An on-campus middleware or system should consume this.

        **Use Case**

            Get a paginated list of mappings between edX users and remote user IDs for all users currently
            linked to the given backend.

            The list can be filtered by edx username or third party ids. The filter is limited by the max length of URL.
            It is suggested to query no more than 50 usernames or remote_ids in each request to stay within above
            limitation

            The page size can be changed by specifying `page_size` parameter in the request.

        **Example Requests**

              GET /api/third_party_auth/v0/providers/{provider_id}/users

              GET /api/third_party_auth/v0/providers/{provider_id}/users?username={username1},{username2}

              GET /api/third_party_auth/v0/providers/{provider_id}/users?username={username1}&usernames={username2}

              GET /api/third_party_auth/v0/providers/{provider_id}/users?remote_id={remote_id1},{remote_id2}

              GET /api/third_party_auth/v0/providers/{provider_id}/users?remote_id={remote_id1}&remote_id={remote_id2}

              GET /api/third_party_auth/v0/providers/{provider_id}/users?username={username1}&remote_id={remote_id1}

        **URL Parameters**

            * provider_id: The unique identifier of third_party_auth provider (e.g. "saml-ubc", "oa2-google", etc.
              This is not the same thing as the backend_name.). (Optional/future: We may also want to allow
              this to be an 'external domain' like 'ssl:MIT' so that this API can also search the legacy
              ExternalAuthMap table used by Standford/MIT)

        **Query Parameters**

            * remote_ids: Optional. List of comma separated remote (third party) user IDs to filter the result set.
              e.g. ?remote_ids=8721384623

            * usernames: Optional. List of comma separated edX usernames to filter the result set.
              e.g. ?usernames=bob123,jane456

            * page, page_size: Optional. Used for paging the result set, especially when getting
              an unfiltered list.

        **Response Values**

            If the request for information about the user is successful, an HTTP 200 "OK" response
            is returned.

            The HTTP 200 response has the following values:

            * count: The number of mappings for the backend.

            * next: The URI to the next page of the mappings.

            * previous: The URI to the previous page of the mappings.

            * num_pages: The number of pages listing the mappings.

            * results:  A list of mappings returned. Each collection in the list
              contains these fields.

                * username: The edx username

                * remote_id: The Id from third party auth provider
