Add Collaborators
*****************


    Studio has support for rudimentary collaborative editing of a course. Users must have registered at studio.edge.edx.org, and must have activated their account via the mail link. If a user is not found, you will be notified.


    Before you add a new user, consider the following.


    · Invited users have full permissions to edit your course, including deleting content created by anyone else.


    · Invited users cannot currently grant new permissions on the course.


    · Editing conflicts are currently not managed. Thus, the state of the course might change between refreshes of the page.


    To give another user permission to edit your course:


    1. On the navigation bar, click **Course Settings**, and then click **Course Team**.

Add Manual Policy Data
**********************



    You can add manual policy data on the **Advanced Settings** page. These advanced configuration options are specified using JSON key and value
    pairs.


    You should only add manual policy data if you are very familiar with valid configuration key value pairs and the ways these pairs will affect your course.
    Errors on this page can cause significant problems with your course.


    The edX program managers can help you learn about how to apply these settings.


    1. On the navigation bar, click **Course Settings**, and then click **Advanced Settings**.


    2. Click **New Manual Policy** .
