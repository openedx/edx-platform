EdX Documentation

/////small change
The following documentation projects have been moved to the `edx-documentation`_ repository as of November 3, 2014:

* course_authors
* data
* developers
* install_operations
* mobile
* OLX
* ORA-2
* release_notes
* students

API documentation that includes docstrings from code files is stored in the
repository of that module.  All other documentation projects are stored in edx-
documentation.

By moving documentation to its own repository, we will be better able to
develop workflows, manage versioning, create translations, and automate
testing, without complicating ongoing development of the edX Platform.
