    \subsection{Problem With Adaptive Hint}

    % Adaptive hints are messages provided to students which depend on
    % student input.  These hints are produced using a script embedded
    % within the problem (written in Python).
    %
    % Here is an example.  This example uses LaTeX as a high-level
    % soure language for the problem.  The problem can also be coded
    % directly in XML.

    This problem demonstrates a question with hints, based on using the
    {\tt hintfn} method.

    \begin{edXscript}
    def test_str(expect, ans):
      print(expect, ans)
      ans = ans.strip("'")
      ans = ans.strip('"')
      return expect == ans.lower()

    def hint_fn(answer_ids, student_answers, new_cmap, old_cmap):
      aid = answer_ids[0]
      ans = str(student_answers[aid]).lower()
      print('hint_fn called, ans=', ans)
      hint = ''
      if 'java' in ans:
         hint = 'that is only good for drinking'
      elif 'perl' in ans:
         hint = 'not that rich'
      elif 'pascal' in ans:
         hint = 'that is a beatnick language'
      elif 'fortran' in ans:
         hint = 'those were the good days'
      elif 'clu' in ans:
         hint = 'you must be invariant'
      if hint:
        hint = "<font color='blue'>Hint: {0}</font>".format(hint)
        new_cmap.set_hint_and_mode(aid,hint,'always')
    \end{edXscript}

    What is the best programming language that exists today?   You may
    enter your answer in upper or lower case, with or without quotes.
