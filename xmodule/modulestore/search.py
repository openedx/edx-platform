def path_to_location(modulestore, usage_key, request=None, full_path=False):
    '''
    Try to find a course_id/chapter/section[/position] path to location in
    modulestore.  The courseware insists that the first level in the course is
    chapter, but any kind of block can be a "section".

    Args:
        modulestore: which store holds the relevant objects
        usage_key: :class:`UsageKey` the id of the location to which to generate the path
        request: Request object containing information about user and masquerade settings, Default is None
        full_path: :class:`Bool` if True, return the full path to location. Default is False.

    Raises
        ItemNotFoundError if the location doesn't exist.
        NoPathToItem if the location exists, but isn't accessible via
            a chapter/section path in the course(s) being searched.

    Returns:
        a tuple (course_id, chapter, section, position) suitable for the
        courseware index view.

    If the section is a sequential or vertical, position will be the children index
    of this location under that sequence.
