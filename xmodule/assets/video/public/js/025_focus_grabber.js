/*
 * 025_focus_grabber.js
 *
 * Purpose: Provide a way to focus on autohidden Video controls.
 *
 *
 * Because in HTML player mode we have a feature of autohiding controls on
 * mouse inactivity, sometimes focus is lost from the currently selected
 * control. What's more, when all controls are autohidden, we can't get to any
 * of them because by default browser does not place hidden elements on the
 * focus chain.
 *
 * To get around this minor annoyance, this module will manage 2 placeholder
 * elements that will be invisible to the user's eye, but visible to the
 * browser. This will allow for a sneaky stealing of focus and placing it where
 * we need (on hidden controls).
 *
 * This code has been moved to a separate module because it provides a concrete
 * block of functionality that can be turned on (off).
