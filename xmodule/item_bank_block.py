        Dynamically selects block_ids indicating which of the possible children are displayed to the current user.

            children - children of this block
            max_count - number of components to display to each student

        NOTE/TODO:
            We like to treat `self.selected` as a list of 2-tuples, but when we load a block from persistence, all
            tuples are quietly converted to lists, so `self.selected` actually ends up being a list of 2-element lists.
            So, we need to carefully convert the items in `self.selected` to tuples whenever we work with it. As a
            future refactoring, it would be much better to just accept that `self.selected` always has 2-element lists,
            and then define some @properties that intentionally convert them to BlockKeys (named 2-tuples) plus type
            annotations to enforce it all.

        Returns:
            A dict containing the following keys:

            'selected' (list) of (block_type, block_id) tuples assigned to this student.
                       Order is RANDOM BUT ALSO SIGNIFICANT, because we want each student's order to remain stable as
                       long as their set of assigned children hasn't changed.

            'invalid' (list) of dropped (block_type, block_id) tuples that are no longer valid
            'overlimit' (list) of dropped (block_type, block_id) tuples that were previously selected
            'added' (list) of newly added (block_type, block_id) tuples

            Order of invalid/overlimit/added is ALPHABETICAL, by type then id. This is arbitrary, but it makes the
            events more consistent and easier to test.
