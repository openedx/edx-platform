# UserPartition IDs must be unique. The Cohort and Random UserPartitions (when they are
# created via Studio) choose an unused ID in the range of 100 (historical) to MAX_INT. Therefore the
# dynamic UserPartitionIDs must be under 100, and they have to be hard-coded to ensure
# they are always the same whenever the dynamic partition is added (since the UserPartition
# ID is stored in the xblock group_access dict).

=======
# Each user partition has an ID that is unique within its learning context.
# The IDs must be valid MySQL primary keys, ie positive integers 1 -> 2^31-1.
# We must carefully manage these IDs, because once they are saved to OLX and the db, they cannot change.
# Here is how we delegate the ID range:
# * 1 -> 49: Unused/Reserved
# * 50: The enrollment track partition
# * 51: The content type gating partition (defined elsewhere)
# * 52-99: Available for other single user partitions, plugged in via setup.py.
#          Operators, beware of conflicting IDs between plugins!
# * 100 -> 2^31-1: General namespace for generating IDs at runtime.
#                  This includes, at least: content partitions, the cohort partition, and teamset partitions.
#                  When using this range, user partition implementations must check to see that they
#                  are not conflicting with an existing partition for the course.
