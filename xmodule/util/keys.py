    Return a new reproducible BlockKey for a given source usage and destination parent block.

    When recursively copying a block structure, we need to generate new block IDs for the
    blocks. We don't want to use the exact same IDs as we might copy blocks multiple times.
    However, we do want to be able to reproduce the same IDs when copying the same block
    so that if we ever need to re-copy the block from its source (that is, to update it with
    upstream changes) we don't affect any data tied to the ID, such as grades.

    This is used by the copy_from_template function of the modulestore, and can be used by
    pluggable django apps that need to copy blocks from one course to another in an
    idempotent way. In the future, this should be created into a proper API function
    in the spirit of OEP-49.
