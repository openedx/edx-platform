    A transformer that enforces the 'start' and 'days_early_for_beta'
    fields on blocks by removing blocks from the block structure for
    which the user does not have access. The 'start' field on a
    block is percolated down to its descendants, so that all blocks
    enforce the 'start' field from their ancestors.  The assumed
    'start' value for a block is then the maximum of its parent and its
    own.

    For a block with multiple parents, the assumed parent start date
    value is a computed minimum of the start dates of all its parents.
    So as long as one parent chain allows access, the block has access.
