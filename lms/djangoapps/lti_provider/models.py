        This method first attempts to find an LtiConsumer by instance_guid.

        of an LTI launch with no instance_guid.

    An outcome service can be identified in two ways, depending on the
    information provided by an LTI launch. The ideal way to identify the service
    is by instance_guid, which should uniquely identify a consumer. However that
    field is optional in the LTI launch, and so if it is missing we can fall
    back on the consumer key (which should be created uniquely for each consumer
