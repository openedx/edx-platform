    """
    View for the "verify and pay" flow.

    This view is somewhat complicated, because the user
    can enter it from a number of different places:

    * From the "choose your track" page.
    * After completing payment.
    * From the dashboard in order to complete verification.
    * From the dashboard in order to upgrade to a verified track.

    The page will display different steps and requirements
    depending on:

    * Whether the user has submitted a photo verification recently.
    * Whether the user has paid for the course.
    * How the user reached the page (mostly affects messaging)

    We are also super-paranoid about how users reach this page.
    If they somehow aren't enrolled, or the course doesn't exist,
    or they've unenrolled, or they've already paid/verified,
    ... then we try to redirect them to the page with the
    most appropriate messaging (including the dashboard).

    Note that this page does NOT handle re-verification
    (photo verification that was denied or had an error);
    that is handled by the "reverify" view.

    # for both payment and verification.  As the user
    # completes these steps (for example, submitting a photo)

    # If a user has already verified for another course,
    # then the verification steps will be hidden,

    # a third-party payment processor), then the user
