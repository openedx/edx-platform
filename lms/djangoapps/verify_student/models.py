Models for Student Identity Verification

This is where we put any models relating to establishing the real-life identity
of a student over a period of time. Right now, the only models are the abstract
`PhotoVerification`, and its one concrete implementation
`SoftwareSecurePhotoVerification`. The hope is to keep as much of the
photo verification process as generic as possible.

    Each PhotoVerification represents a Student's attempt to establish
    their identity by uploading a photo of themselves and a picture ID. An
    attempt actually has a number of fields that need to be filled out at
    different steps of the approval process. While it's useful as a Django Model
    for the querying facilities, **you should only edit a `PhotoVerification`
    object through the methods provided**. Initialize them with a user:

    attempt = PhotoVerification(user=user)

    We track this attempt through various states:

    `created`
        Initial creation and state we're in after uploading the images.
    `ready`
        The user has uploaded their images and checked that they can read the
        images. There's a separate state here because it may be the case that we
        don't actually submit this attempt for review until payment is made.
    `submitted`
        Submitted for review. The review may be done by a staff member or an
        external service. The user cannot make changes once in this state.
    `must_retry`
        We submitted this, but there was an error on submission (i.e. we did not
        get a 200 when we POSTed to Software Secure)
    `approved`
        An admin or an external service has confirmed that the user's photo and
        photo ID match up, and that the photo ID's name matches the user's.
    `denied`
        The request has been denied. See `error_msg` for details on why. An
        admin might later override this and change to `approved`, but the
        student cannot re-open this attempt -- they have to create another
        attempt and submit it instead.

    Because this Model inherits from IDVerificationAttempt, which inherits
    from StatusModel, we can also do things like:

    Model to verify identity using a service provided by Software Secure. Much
    of the logic is inherited from `PhotoVerification`, but this class
    encrypts the photos.

    Software Secure (http://www.softwaresecure.com/) is a remote proctoring
    service that also does identity verification. A student uses their webcam
    to upload two images: one of their face, one of a photo ID. Due to the
    sensitive nature of the data, the following security precautions are taken:

    1. The snapshot of their face is encrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode. All
       face photos are encypted with the same key, and this key is known to
       both Software Secure and edx-platform.

    2. The snapshot of a user's photo ID is also encrypted using AES-256, but
       the key is randomly generated using os.urandom. Every verification
       attempt has a new key. The AES key is then encrypted using a public key
       provided by Software Secure. We store only the RSA-encryped AES key.
       Since edx-platform does not have Software Secure's private RSA key, it
       means that we can no longer even read photo ID.

    3. The encrypted photos are base64 encoded and stored in an S3 bucket that
       edx-platform does not have read access to.

    Note: this model handles *inital* verifications (which you must perform
    at the time you register for a verified cert).
