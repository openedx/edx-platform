    **Use Case**
        This endpoint allows clients to register a device for push notifications.

        If the device is already registered, the existing registration will be updated.
        If setting PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_SETTINGS is not configured, the endpoint will return a 501 error.

    **Example Request**
        POST /api/mobile/{version}/notifications/create-token/
        **POST Parameters**
          The body of the POST request can include the following parameters.
          * name (optional) - A name of the device.
          * registration_id (required) - The device token of the device.
          * device_id (optional) - ANDROID_ID / TelephonyManager.getDeviceId() (always as hex)
          * active (optional) - Whether the device is active, default is True.
            If False, the device will not receive notifications.
          * cloud_message_type (required) - You should choose FCM or GCM. Currently, only FCM is supported.
          * application_id (optional) - Opaque application identity, should be filled in for multiple
            key/certificate access. Should be equal settings.FCM_APP_NAME.
