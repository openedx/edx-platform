    downloadable        - The user has been granted this certificate and the certificate is ready and available.
    error               - An error occurred during PDF certificate generation.
    generating          - A request has been made to generate a PDF certificate, but it has not been generated yet.
    honor_passing       - User is in the honor track and has achieved a passing grade.
    invalidated         - Certificate is not valid.

    unverified          - The user does not have an approved, unexpired identity verification.
