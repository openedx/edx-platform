"""
This file contains (or should), all access control logic for the courseware.
Ideally, it will be the only place that needs to know about any special settings
like DISABLE_START_DATES.

Note: The access control logic in this file does NOT check for enrollment in
  a course.  It is expected that higher layers check for enrollment so we
  don't have to hit the enrollments table on every block load.

  If enrollment is to be checked, use get_course_with_access in courseware.courses.
  It is a wrapper around has_access that additionally checks for enrollment.
