        **Use Cases**

            Get or create a course team.

        **Example Requests**:

            GET /api/team/v0/teams

            POST /api/team/v0/teams

        **Query Parameters for GET**

            * course_id: Filters the result to teams belonging to the given
              course. Required.

            * topic_id: Filters the result to teams associated with the given
              topic.

            * text_search: Searches for full word matches on the name, description,
              country, and language fields. NOTES: Search is on full names for countries
              and languages, not the ISO codes. Text_search cannot be requested along with
              with order_by.

            * order_by: Cannot be called along with with text_search. Must be one of the following:

                * name: Orders results by case insensitive team name (default).

                * open_slots: Orders results by most open slots (for tie-breaking,
                  last_activity_at is used, with most recent first).

                * last_activity_at: Orders result by team activity, with most active first
                  (for tie-breaking, open_slots is used, with most open slots first).

            * username: Return teams whose membership contains the given user.

            * page_size: Number of results to return per page.

            * page: Page number to retrieve.

            * expand: Comma separated list of types for which to return
              expanded representations. Supports "user" and "team".

        **Response Values for GET**

            If the user is logged in and enrolled, the response contains:

            * count: The total number of teams matching the request.

            * next: The URL to the next page of results, or null if this is the
              last page.

            * previous: The URL to the previous page of results, or null if this
              is the first page.

            * num_pages: The total number of pages in the result.

            * results: A list of the teams matching the request.

                * id: The team's unique identifier.

                * discussion_topic_id: The unique id of the comments service
                  discussion topic associated with this team.

                * name: The name of the team.

                * course_id: The identifier for the course this team belongs to.

                * topic_id: Optionally specifies which topic the team is associated
                  with.

                * date_created: Date and time when the team was created.

                * description: A description of the team.

                * country: Optionally specifies which country the team is
                  associated with.

                * language: Optionally specifies which language the team is
                  associated with.

                * last_activity_at: The date of the last activity of any team member
                  within the team.

                * membership: A list of the users that are members of the team.
                  See membership endpoint for more detail.

                * organization_protected: Whether the team consists of organization-protected
                  learners

            For all text fields, clients rendering the values should take care
            to HTML escape them to avoid script injections, as the data is
            stored exactly as specified. The intention is that plain text is
            supported, not HTML.

            If the user is not logged in, a 401 error is returned.

            If the user is not enrolled in the course specified by course_id or
            is not course or global staff, a 403 error is returned.

            If the specified course_id is not valid or the user attempts to
            use an unsupported query parameter, a 400 error is returned.

            If the response does not exist, a 404 error is returned. For
            example, the course_id may not reference a real course or the page
            number may be beyond the last page.

            If the server is unable to connect to Elasticsearch, and
            the text_search parameter is supplied, a 503 error is returned.

            If the requesting user is a learner, the learner would only see organization
            protected set of teams if the learner is enrolled in a degree bearing institution.
            Otherwise, the learner will only see organization unprotected set of teams.

        **Response Values for POST**

            Any logged in user who has verified their email address can create
            a team in an open teamset. The format mirrors that of a GET for an individual team,
            but does not include the id, date_created, or membership fields.
            id is automatically computed based on name.

            If the user is not logged in, a 401 error is returned.

            If the user is not enrolled in the course, is not course or
            global staff, or does not have discussion privileges a 403 error
            is returned.

            If the course_id is not valid, or the topic_id is missing, or extra fields
            are included in the request, a 400 error is returned.

            If the specified course does not exist, a 404 error is returned.
            If the specified teamset does not exist, a 404 error is returned.
            If the specified teamset does exist, but the requesting user shouldn't be
            able to see it, a 404 is returned.

        **Query Parameters for GET**

            At least one of username and team_id must be provided.

            * username: Returns membership records only for the specified user.
              If the requesting user is not staff then only memberships for
              teams associated with courses in which the requesting user is
              enrolled are returned.

            * team_id: Returns only membership records associated with the
              specified team. The requesting user must be staff or enrolled in
              the course associated with the team.

            * teamset_id: Returns membership records only for the specified teamset.
              if teamset_id is specified, course_id must also be specified.
              teamset_id and team_id are mutually exclusive. For open and public_managed
              teamsets, the user must be staff or enrolled in the course. For
              private_managed teamsets, the user must be course staff, or a member of the
              specified teamset.

            * course_id: Returns membership records only for the specified
              course. Username must have access to this course, or else team_id
              must be in this course.

            * page_size: Number of results to return per page.

            * page: Page number to retrieve.

            * expand: Comma separated list of types for which to return
              expanded representations. Supports "user" and "team".

        **Response Values for GET**

            If the user is logged in and enrolled, the response contains:

            * count: The total number of memberships matching the request.

            * next: The URL to the next page of results, or null if this is the
              last page.

            * previous: The URL to the previous page of results, or null if this
              is the first page.

            * num_pages: The total number of pages in the result.

            * results: A list of the memberships matching the request.

                * user: The user associated with the membership. This field may
                  contain an expanded or collapsed representation.

                * team: The team associated with the membership. This field may
                  contain an expanded or collapsed representation.

                * date_joined: The date and time the membership was created.

                * last_activity_at: The date of the last activity of the user
                  within the team.

            For all text fields, clients rendering the values should take care
            to HTML escape them to avoid script injections, as the data is
            stored exactly as specified. The intention is that plain text is
            supported, not HTML.

            If the user is not logged in and active, a 401 error is returned.

            If neither team_id nor username are provided, a 400 error is
            returned.

            If team_id is provided but the team does not exist, a 404 error is
            returned.

            If the specified course_id is invalid, a 404 error is returned.

            This endpoint uses 404 error codes to avoid leaking information
            about team or user existence. Specifically, a 404 error will be
            returned if a logged in user specifies a team_id for a course
            they are not enrolled in.

            Additionally, when username is specified the list of returned
            memberships will be filtered to memberships in teams associated
            with courses that the requesting user is enrolled in.

            If the course specified by course_id does not contain the team
            specified by team_id, a 400 error is returned.

            If the user is not enrolled in the course specified by course_id,
            and does not have staff access to the course, a 400 error is
            returned.

        **Response Values for POST**

            Any logged in user enrolled in a course can enroll themselves in a
            team in the course. Course staff, global staff, and discussion
            privileged users can enroll any user in a team, with a few
            exceptions noted below.

            If the user is not logged in and active, a 401 error is returned.

            If username and team are not provided in the posted JSON, a 400
            error is returned describing the missing fields.

            If the specified team does not exist, a 404 error is returned.

            If the user is not staff, does not have discussion privileges,
            and is not enrolled in the course associated with the team they
            are trying to join, or if they are trying to add a user other
            than themselves to a team, a 404 error is returned. This is to
            prevent leaking information about the existence of teams and users.

            If the specified user does not exist, a 404 error is returned.

            If the user is already a member of a team in the course associated
            with the team they are trying to join, a 400 error is returned.
            This applies to both staff and students.

            If the user is not enrolled in the course associated with the team
            they are trying to join, a 400 error is returned. This can occur
            when a staff or discussion privileged user posts a request adding
            another user to a team.

        **Use Cases**

            Gets individual course team memberships or removes a user from a course team.

        **Example Requests**:

            GET /api/team/v0/team_membership/{team_id},{username}

            DELETE /api/team/v0/team_membership/{team_id},{username}

        **Query Parameters for GET**

            * expand: Comma separated list of types for which to return
              expanded representations. Supports "user" and "team".

        **Response Values for GET**

            If the user is logged in and enrolled, or is course or global staff
            the response contains:

            * user: The user associated with the membership. This field may
              contain an expanded or collapsed representation.

            * team: The team associated with the membership. This field may
              contain an expanded or collapsed representation.

            * date_joined: The date and time the membership was created.

            * last_activity_at: The date of the last activity of any team member
                within the team.

            For all text fields, clients rendering the values should take care
            to HTML escape them to avoid script injections, as the data is
            stored exactly as specified. The intention is that plain text is
            supported, not HTML.

            If the user is not logged in and active, a 401 error is returned.

            If specified team does not exist, a 404 error is returned.

            If the user is logged in but is not enrolled in the course
            associated with the specified team, or is not staff, a 404 error is
            returned. This avoids leaking information about course or team
            existence.

            If the membership does not exist, a 404 error is returned.

        **Response Values for DELETE**

            Any logged in user enrolled in a course can remove themselves from
            a team in the course. Course staff, global staff, and discussion
            privileged users can remove any user from a team. Successfully
            deleting a membership will return a 204 response with no content.

            If the user is not logged in and active, a 401 error is returned.

            If the specified team or username does not exist, a 404 error is
            returned.

            If the user is not staff or a discussion privileged user and is
            attempting to remove another user from a team, a 404 error is
            returned. This prevents leaking information about team and user
            existence.

            If the membership does not exist, a 404 error is returned.
