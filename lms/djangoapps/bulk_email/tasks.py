        'task_id' : id of subtask.  This is used to pass task information across retries.
        'attempted' : number of attempts -- should equal succeeded plus failed

        'retried_withmax' : number of times the subtask has been retried for conditions that
            should have a maximum count applied
        'state' : celery state of the subtask (e.g. QUEUING, PROGRESS, RETRY, FAILURE, SUCCESS)

      * Second value is an exception returned by the innards of the method.  If the retry was
        successfully submitted, this value will be the RetryTaskError that retry() returns.
