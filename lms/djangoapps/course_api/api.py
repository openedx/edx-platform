def get_course_members(course_key):
    """
    Returns a dict containing all users with access to a course through CourseEnrollment
    and CourseAccessRole models.

    User information includes id, email, username, name, enrollment mode and role list.

    This API is limited and will only work for courses with less than a configurable number
    of active enrollments (managed through `settings.COURSE_MEMBER_API_ENROLLMENT_LIMIT`,
    and the default value is 1000). More than that and the method will raise a
    `OverEnrollmentLimitException` exception.

    This method works by querying the `CourseEnrollment` and `CourseAccessRole` models,
    prefetching user information and *then joining results in Python using dictionaries*.
    This approach was choosen to avoid database heavy queries (such as DISTINCT and COUNT) in
    the `CourseEnrollment` table, which would take too long to complete in a request lifecycle.

    The main concern with this approach is the dataset size and resource usage since this method
    returns all enrollments without pagination. We're using a conservative number on the
    `COURSE_MEMBER_API_ENROLLMENT_LIMIT` setting to avoid any issues.

    Examples:
        - Get all course members:
            get_course_members(course_key)

    Arguments:
        course_key (CourseKey): CourseKey to retrieve student data.
