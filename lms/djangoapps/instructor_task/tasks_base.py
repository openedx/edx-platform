    Base task class for use with InstructorTask models.

    The `entry_id` is the primary key for the InstructorTask entry representing the task.  This class
    updates the entry on success and failure of the task it wraps.  It is setting the entry's value
    for task_state based on what Celery would set it to once the task returns to Celery:
    FAILURE if an exception is encountered, and SUCCESS if it returns normally.
    Other arguments are pass-throughs to perform_module_state_update, and documented there.
