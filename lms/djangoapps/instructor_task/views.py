    """
    View method that returns the status of a course-related task or tasks.

    Status is returned as a JSON-serialized dict, wrapped as the content of a HTTPResponse.

    The task_id can be specified to this view in one of two ways:

    * by making a request containing 'task_id' as a parameter with a single value
      Returns a dict containing status information for the specified task_id

    * by making a request containing 'task_ids' as a parameter,
      with a list of task_id values.
      Returns a dict of dicts, with the task_id as key, and the corresponding
      dict containing status information for the specified task_id

      Task_id values that are unrecognized are skipped.

    The dict with status information for a task contains the following keys:
      'message': on complete tasks, status message reporting on final progress,
          or providing exception message if failed.  For tasks in progress,
          indicates the current progress.
      'succeeded': on complete tasks or tasks in progress, boolean value indicates if the
          task outcome was successful:  did it achieve what it set out to do.
          This is in contrast with a successful task_state, which indicates that the
          task merely completed.
      'task_id': id assigned by LMS and used by celery.
      'task_state': state of task as stored in celery's result store.
      'in_progress': boolean indicating if task is still running.
      'task_progress': dict containing progress information.  This includes:
          'attempted': number of attempts made
          'succeeded': number of attempts that "succeeded"
          'total': number of possible subtasks to attempt
          'action_name': user-visible verb to use in status messages.  Should be past-tense.
          'duration_ms': how long the task has (or had) been running.
          'exception': name of exception class raised in failed tasks.
          'message': returned for failed and revoked tasks.
          'traceback': optional, returned if task failed and produced a traceback.

    responses, and while the task runs to completion, some of the students'
