    Management command to manually link ProgramEnrollments without an LMS user to an LMS user by
    username.

    Usage:
        ./manage.py lms link_program_enrollments <program_uuid> <user_item>*
        where a <user_item> is a string formatted as <external_user_key>:<lms_username>

    Normally, program enrollments should be linked by the Django Social Auth post_save signal
    handler `lms.djangoapps.program_enrollments.signals.matriculate_learner`, but in the case that
    a partner does not have an IDP set up for learners to log in through, we need a way to link
    enrollments.

    Provided a program uuid and a list of external_user_key:lms_username, this command will look up
    the matching program enrollments and users, and update the program enrollments with the matching
    user. If the program enrollment has course enrollments, we will enroll the user into their
    waiting program courses.

    If an external user key is specified twice, an exception will be raised and no enrollments will
    be modified.

    For each external_user_key:lms_username, if:
        - The user is not found
        - No enrollment is found for the given program and external_user_key
        - The enrollment already has a user
    An error message will be logged and the input will be skipped. All other inputs will be
    processed and enrollments updated.

    If there is an error while enrolling a user in a waiting program course enrollment, the error
    will be logged, and we will roll back all transactions for that user so that their db state will
    be the same as it was before this command was run. This is to allow the re-running of the same
    command again to correctly enroll the user once the issue preventing the enrollment has been
    resolved.

    No other users will be affected, they will be processed normally.
