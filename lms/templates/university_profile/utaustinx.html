<%block name="university_description">
    <p>The University of Texas at Austin is the top-ranked public university in a nearly 1,000-mile radius, and is ranked in the top 25 universities in the world. Students have been finding their passion in life at UT Austin for more than 130 years, and it has been a member of the prestigious AAU since 1929. UT Austin combines the academic depth and breadth of a world research institute (regularly ranking  within the top three producers of doctoral degrees in the country) with the fun and excitement of a big-time collegiate experience.  It is currently the fifth-largest university in America, with more than 50,000 students and 3,000 professors across 17 colleges and schools. UT Austin will be opening the Dell Medical School in 2016.</p>
