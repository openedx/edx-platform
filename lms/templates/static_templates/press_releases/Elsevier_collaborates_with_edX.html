      <p>&ldquo;We are honored to collaborate with edX,&rdquo; said Suzanne BeDell, Managing Director, Science and Technology Books, Elsevier. &ldquo;With this new course, hundreds of thousands of students around the world will have had free access to the cutting-edge content contained in Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits.&rdquo;</p>
