          <h3>Platform Developer</h3>
          <p>Platform Developers build the core learning platform that powers edX, writing both front-end and back-end code. They tackle a wide range of technical challenges, and so the best candidates will have a strong background in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, education, user interaction design, big data, social network analysis, and devops. Specialists are encouraged to apply, but team members often wear many hats. Our ideal candidate would have excellent coding skills, a proven history of delivering projects, and a deep research background.</p>
