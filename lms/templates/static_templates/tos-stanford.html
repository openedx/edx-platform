  <p id="privacy"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>Stanford considers the confidentiality and security of your information to be of the utmost importance. Stanford will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your Personally Identifiable Information private and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless Stanford has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. Stanford takes reasonable measures to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from disclosure to or access by third parties. Please note that Stanford does not guarantee the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted.</p>
  <p><strong>What Information this Privacy Policy Covers</strong></p>
  <p>Some of our Site's functionality can be used without revealing any personal information; however, for features or services related to an online course registration and participation, personal information is required. If you do not use these specific features or services on the Site, then the only information Stanford collects will be "Non-Personal Information" (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed.</p>
  <p>In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit "Personally Identifiable Information" (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Stanford. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary means by which we communicate with you.</p>
  <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through the Site and does not apply to information that we may collect from you through other means such as by mail or over the phone.</p>
  <p><strong>What You Consent to by Using Our Site</strong></p>
