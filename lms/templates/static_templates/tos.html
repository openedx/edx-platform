The Constitution Foundation, d/b/a/ the Saylor Foundation (“The Foundation”) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with a business office at 1000 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W., Washington D.C. 20007.  Please read these terms carefully because they apply to your use of all of the websites and services that the Foundation operates

Unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Foundation, your use of any Foundation controlled Website or Service will always be subject to, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to as the “Terms.” 


Your Agreement to the Terms.
Your access or use in any way of any Foundation controlled website or service, including, but not limited to, our “ePortfolio” and discussion forums signifies that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms. By accessing or using any Foundation controlled Website or Service you also represent that you have the legal authority to accept the Terms on behalf of yourself and any party you represent in connection with your use of any Website or Service.  If you do not agree to the Terms, you are not authorized to use any Website or Service.


Changes to the Terms.
From time to time, the Foundation may change, remove, add to or otherwise modify the Terms, and reserves the right to do so at its discretion.  In that case, we will post the updated Terms, as relevant, to the applicable Website(s) and indicate the date of revision. We encourage you to periodically review the Terms.  In addition, if our modifications are material, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you electronically.  For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or we may display a notice on the Websites indicating that the Terms have changed.

All new and/or amended Terms take effect immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no modification to the Terms will apply to any dispute between you and the Foundation that arose prior to the effective date of any modification and (ii) if you do not agree with any modification to the Terms, you may terminate this agreement by ceasing use of the Foundation controlled Websites and Services.

Terms Relating to Content on the Websites and Services.
Responsibility for Content.  You understand that all material, data and information, such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images (collectively, “Content”) which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Websites and Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. This includes assertions that persons may make, expressly or impliedly, about the provenance and ownership of Content that they supply, upload, list and/or link to. You understand that by using the Websites and Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances is the Foundation liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to: any infringing Content, any errors or omissions in Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, transmitted to, linked to or otherwise accessible or made available via the Websites and Services.
Content You Provide.  You may only submit Content to the Websites or in connection with the Services that you have the right to submit.  This means that you can only submit Content that you yourself create, that is in the public domain or that you have been expressly granted the right to submit consistent with these Terms.  For the avoidance of doubt, Content that infringes the rights of any third party (e.g., Content used without express permission of the copyright owner and not otherwise permitted by law) must not be submitted.
You represent, warrant and agree that no Content of any kind submitted, posted or otherwise shared by you on or through any of the Foundation controlled Websites or Services, violates or infringes upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary rights; or contains libelous, defamatory or otherwise unlawful material. Further, you represent, warrant and agree not to submit any personally identifiable information, including any Content containing personally identifiable information, about any person who is under 13 years of age.

The Foundation may, but is not obligated to, review your submissions and may delete or remove (without notice) any Content at its sole discretion that the Foundation determines violates the Terms or that may be offensive, illegal, or that might violate the rights, harm or threaten the safety of others. The Foundation does not endorse or support any Content posted by you or any other third party on or through the Websites or Services. You alone are responsible for creating backup copies and replacing any Content you post on the Websites or Services, and you authorize the Foundation to make copies of your Content as deemed necessary in order to facilitate the posting of your Content on the Websites or Services.

You represent and warrant to the Foundation that you will use any and all Content on our Websites or Services in accordance with the applicable license. You should be sure to review the terms of that license before you use the Content to which it applies so that you know what you can and cannot do. By using the Websites or Services, you agree that you are solely responsible for your use of any and all Content made available thereon. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the provenance, ownership, accuracy, completeness, or reliability of such Content.
