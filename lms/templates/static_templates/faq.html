            <h3>What is edX?</h3>
            <p>edX is a not-for-profit enterprise of its founding partners, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University that offers online learning to on-campus students and to millions of people around the world. To do so, edX is building an open-source online learning platform and hosts an online web portal at <a href="http://www.edx.org">www.edx.org</a> for online education.</p>
            <p>EdX currently offers HarvardX, <em>MITx</em> and BerkeleyX classes online for free. Beginning in Summer 2013, edX will also offer UTx (University of Texas) classes online for free. The University of Texas System includes nine universities and six health institutions. The edX institutions aim to extend their collective reach to build a global community of online students. Along with offering online courses, the three universities undertake research on how students learn and how technology can transform learning – both on-campus and online throughout the world.</p>

            <h3>What are "X Universities"?</h3>
            <p>Harvard, MIT and UC Berkeley, as the first universities whose courses are delivered on the edX website, are "X Universities." The three institutions will work collaboratively to establish the "X University" Consortium, whose membership will expand to include additional "X Universities" as soon as possible. Each member of the consortium will offer courses on the edX platform as an "X University." The gathering of many universities’ educational content together on one site will enable learners worldwide to access the course content of any participating university from a single website, and to use a set of online educational tools shared by all participating universities. </p>

            <h3>Why is UC Berkeley joining edX?</h3>
            <p>Like Harvard and MIT, UC Berkeley seeks to transform education in quality, efficiency and scale through technology and research, for the benefit of campus-based students and the global community of online learners. </p>
            <p>UC Berkeley also shares the edX commitment to the not-for-profit and open-platform model as a way to enhance human fulfillment worldwide. </p>

            <h3>What will UC Berkeley's direct participation entail?</h3>
            <p>UC Berkeley will begin by offering two courses on edX in Fall 2012, and will collaborate on the development of the technology platform. We will explore, experiment and innovate together.</p>
            <p>UC Berkeley will also serve as the inaugural chair of the "X University" Consortium for an initial 5 year period.  As Chair, UC Berkeley will participate on the edX Board on behalf of the X Universities.</p>

            <h3>Why is The University of Texas System joining edX?</h3>
            <p>Joining edX not only allows UT faculty to showcase their work on a global stage, but also provides UT students the opportunity to take classes from their choice of UT institutions, as well as MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley and future &ldquo;X&rdquo; Universities.</p>
            <p>The UT System closely examined all the alternatives and determined that edX offered the best fit in terms of alignment of mission, platform and revenue model. The strength and reputation of the partner institutions – MIT, Harvard and UC Berkeley – was also a huge consideration. EdX is committed to both blended and online learning and to a non-profit, open source model. It is also governed by a board of academics with a commitment to excellence in learning.</p>

        <article class="response">
            <h3>What will The UT System’s direct participation entail?</h3>
            <p>The UT System will begin by offering one course on edX from The University of Texas at Austin in Summer 2013, and four courses in Fall 2013, likely at least one of those courses from one of its health institutions. The UT System is also making a $5 million investment in the edX platform. We will explore, experiment and innovate together.</p>

            <h3>Will edX be adding additional X Universities?</h3>
            <p>More than 140 institutions from around the world have expressed interest in collaborating with edX since Harvard and MIT announced its creation in May. EdX is focused above all on quality and developing the best not-for-profit model for online education. In addition to providing online courses on the edX platform, the &ldquo;X University&rdquo; Consortium will be a forum in which members can share experiences around online learning. Harvard, MIT, UC Berkeley and the UT System will work collaboratively to establish the &ldquo;X University&rdquo; Consortium, whose membership will expand to include additional &ldquo;X Universities&rdquo; as soon as possible. Each member of the consortium will offer courses on the edX platform as an &ldquo;X University.&rdquo; The gathering of many universities’ educational content together on one site will enable learners worldwide to access the course content of any participating university from a single website, and to use a set of online educational tools shared by all participating universities.</p>
            <p>EdX will actively explore the addition of other institutions from around the world to the edX platform, and we look forward to adding more &ldquo;X Universities&rdquo; as capacity increases. </p>

            <h3>Who can take edX courses? Will there be an admissions process?</h3>
            <p>EdX will be available to anyone in the world with an internet connection, and in general, there will not be an admissions process.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="response">
            <h3>Will certificates be awarded?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Online learners who demonstrate mastery of subjects can earn a certificate of completion. Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of the underlying "X University" from where the course originated, i.e. HarvardX, <em>MITx</em> or BerkeleyX.  For the courses in Fall 2012, those certificates will be free.  There is a plan to charge a modest fee for certificates in the future.</p>

            <h3>What will the scope of the online courses be? How many? Which faculty?</h3>
            <p>Our goal is to offer a wide variety of courses across disciplines. There are currently <a href="${reverse('courses')}">seven courses</a> offered for Fall 2012.</p>

            <h3>Who is the learner? Domestic or international? Age range?</h3>
            <p>Improving teaching and learning for students on our campuses is one of our primary goals. Beyond that, we don’t have a target group of potential learners, as the goal is to make these courses available to anyone in the world – from any demographic – who has interest in advancing their own knowledge. The only requirement is to have a computer with an internet connection. More than 150,000 students from over 160 countries registered for MITx's first course, 6.002x: Circuits and Electronics. The age range of students certified in this course was from 14 to 74 years-old.</p>

        <h2>Technology Platform</h2>
        <article class="response">
            <h3>What technology will edX use?</h3>
            <p>The edX open-source online learning platform will feature interactive learning designed specifically for the web. Features will include: self-paced learning, online discussion groups, wiki-based collaborative learning, assessment of learning as a student progresses through a course, and online laboratories and other interactive learning tools. The platform will also serve as a laboratory from which data will be gathered to better understand how students learn. Because it is open source, the platform will be continuously improved by a worldwide community of collaborators, with new features added as needs arise.</p>
            <p>The first version of the technology was used in the first <em>MITx</em> course, 6.002x Circuits and Electronics, which launched in Spring, 2012.</p>

            <h3>How is this different from what other universities are doing online?</h3>
            <p>EdX is a not-for-profit enterprise built upon the shared educational missions of its founding partners, Harvard University and MIT. The edX platform will be available as open source. Also, a primary goal of edX is to improve teaching and learning on campus by experimenting with blended models of learning and by supporting faculty in conducting significant research on how students learn.</p>
