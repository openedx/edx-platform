            <p>EdX classes take place at your convenience. Prefer to sleep in and study late? No worries.

            <p>Good news: there are unlimited "mulligans" in edX. You may re-take edX courses as often as you wish. Your performance in any particular offering of a course will not effect your standing in future offerings of any edX course, including future offerings of the same course.</p>

            <p>Yes, but you will not be able to turn in any assignments or exams that have already been due. If it is early in the course, you might still be able to earn enough points for a certificate, but you will have to check with the course in question in order to find out more.</p>
