## Greeting
${_("Hi there,")}

## Preamble
${_("You successfully changed the email address associated with your "
    "{platform_name} account from {old_email} to {new_email}.").format(
        platform_name=settings.PLATFORM_NAME,
        old_email=old_email,

## Translators: This is the signature of an email. "\n" is a newline character,
## and should be placed between the closing word and the signing team's name.
${_("Thanks,\n - The {platform_name} Team").format(
  platform_name=settings.PLATFORM_NAME,
)}
