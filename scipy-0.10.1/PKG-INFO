Description: SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
        science, and engineering. The SciPy library
        depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional
        array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy
        arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical
        routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.
        Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to
        install, and are free of charge.  NumPy and SciPy are easy to use,
        but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's
        leading scientists and engineers. If you need to manipulate
        numbers on a computer and display or publish the results,
        give SciPy a try!
