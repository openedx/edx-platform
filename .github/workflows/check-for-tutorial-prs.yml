# This workflow detects PRs that make changes to lms/templates/dashboard.html
# and only lms/templates/dashboard.html. This is the file that users are
# guided through changing in the Open edX tutorial:
# https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/quickstarts/first_openedx_pr.html#exercise-update-the-learner-dashboard

# If this is the only file changed in the PR, we comment on the PR congratulating
# the user and letting others know that this is not a community PR in need of
# review. CODEOWNERS will tag a triaging team to provide reviews & ultimately
# close the PR.
