WSGI config for CMS.

This module contains the WSGI application used by Django's development server
and any production WSGI deployments.
It exposes a module-level variable named ``application``. Django's
``runserver`` and ``runfcgi`` commands discover this application via the
``WSGI_APPLICATION`` setting.

Import sorting is intentionally disabled in this module.
