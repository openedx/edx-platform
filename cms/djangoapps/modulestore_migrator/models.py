    A legacy learning context (course or library) which can be a source of a migration.

    One source can be associated with multiple (successful or unsuccessful) ModulestoreMigrations.
    If a source has been migrated multiple times, then at most one of them can be considered the
    "official" or "authoritative" migration; this is indicated by setting the `forwarded` field to
    that ModulestoreMigration object.

    Note that `forwarded` can be NULL even when 1+ migrations have happened for this source. This just
    means that none of them were authoritative. In other words, they were all "imports"/"copies" rather
    than true "migrations".

    In practice, as of Ulmo:
    * The `forwarded` field is used to decide how to update legacy library_content references.
    * When using the Libraries Migration UI in Studio, `forwarded` is always set to the first
      successful ModulestoreMigration.
    * When using the REST API directly, the default is to use the same behavior as the UI, but
      clients can also explicitly specify the `forward_source_to_target` boolean param in order to
      control whether `forwarded` is set to any given migration.
