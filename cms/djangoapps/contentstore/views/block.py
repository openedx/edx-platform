# Disable atomic requests so transactions made during the request commit immediately instead of waiting for the end of

# during the request. One example is the async tasks launched when courses are published before the request
# ends, which end up reading from an outdated state of the database. For more information see the discussion in the
# following PR: https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/pull/34020

    The restful handler for xblock requests.

    DELETE
        json: delete this xblock instance from the course.
    GET
        json: returns representation of the xblock (locator id, data, and metadata).
              if ?fields=graderType, it returns the graderType for the unit instead of the above.
              if ?fields=ancestorInfo, it returns ancestor info of the xblock.
        html: returns HTML for rendering the xblock (which includes both the "preview" view and the "editor" view)
    PUT or POST or PATCH
        json: if xblock locator is specified, update the xblock instance. The json payload can contain
              these fields, all optional:
                :data: the new value for the data.
                :children: the unicode representation of the UsageKeys of children for this xblock.
                :metadata: new values for the metadata fields. Any whose values are None will be deleted not set
                       to None! Absent ones will be left alone.
                :fields: any other xblock fields to be set. Only supported by update.
                    This is represented as a dictionary:
                        {'field_name': 'field_value'}
                :nullout: which metadata fields to set to None
                :graderType: change how this unit is graded
                :isPrereq: Set this xblock as a prerequisite which can be used to limit access to other xblocks
                :prereqUsageKey: Use the xblock identified by this usage key to limit access to this xblock
                :prereqMinScore: The minimum score that needs to be achieved on the prerequisite xblock
                        identifed by prereqUsageKey. Ranging from 0 to 100.
                :prereqMinCompletion: The minimum completion percentage that needs to be achieved on the
                        prerequisite xblock identifed by prereqUsageKey. Ranging from 0 to 100.
                :publish: can be:
                  'make_public': publish the content
                  'republish': publish this item *only* if it was previously published
                  'discard_changes' - reverts to the last published version

                to update and discard changes in a single operation.

              if usage_key_string is not specified, create a new xblock instance, either by duplicating
              an existing xblock, or creating an entirely new one. The json playload can contain
              these fields:
                :parent_locator: parent for new xblock, required for duplicate, move and create new instance
                :duplicate_source_locator: if present, use this as the source for creating a duplicate copy
                :move_source_locator: if present, use this as the source item for moving
                :target_index: if present, use this as the target index for moving an item to a particular index
                    otherwise target_index is calculated. It is sent back in the response.
                :category: type of xblock, required if duplicate_source_locator is not present.
                :display_name: name for new xblock, optional
                :boilerplate: template name for populating fields, optional and only used
                     if duplicate_source_locator is not present
                :staged_content: use "clipboard" to paste from the OLX user's clipboard. (Incompatible with all other
                     fields except parent_locator)
