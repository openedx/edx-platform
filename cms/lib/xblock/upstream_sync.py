Synchronize content and settings from upstream blocks to their downstream usages.

At the time of writing, we assume that for any upstream-downstream linkage:
* The upstream is a Component from a Learning Core-backed Content Library.
* The downstream is a block of matching type in a SplitModuleStore-backed Course.
* They are both on the same Open edX instance.

HOWEVER, those assumptions may loosen in the future. So, we consider these to be INTERNAL ASSUMPIONS that should not be
exposed through this module's public Python interface.

    #
    #   - future upstream syncs will NOT blow away the customization,
    #   - but future upstream syncs WILL fetch the upstream values and tuck them away in a hidden field,
    #   - and the author can can revert back to said fetched upstream value at any point.
    #
    # Now, whether field is "customized" (and thus "revertible") is dependent on whether they have ever edited it.
    # To instrument this, we need to keep track of which customizable fields have been edited using a new XBlock field:
    # `downstream_customized`
    #
    # Implementing `downstream_customized` has proven difficult, because there is no simple way to keep it up-to-date
    # with the many different ways XBlock fields can change. The `.save()` and `.editor_saved()` methods are promising,
    # but we need to do more due diligence to be sure that they cover all cases, including API edits, import/export,
    # copy/paste, etc. We will figure this out in time for the full Content Libraries Relaunch (related ticket:
    # https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-authoring/issues/1317). But, for the Beta realease, we're going to
    # implement something simpler:
    #
    # - We fetch upstream values for customizable fields and tuck them away in a hidden field (same as above).
    # - If a customizable field DOES match the fetched upstream value, then future upstream syncs DO update it.
