Synchronize content and settings from upstream content to their downstream
usages.

At the time of writing, we assume that for any upstream-downstream linkage:
* The upstream is a Component or Container from a Learning Core-backed Content
  Library.
* The downstream is a block of compatible type in a SplitModuleStore-backed
  Course.
* They are both on the same Open edX instance.

HOWEVER, those assumptions may loosen in the future. So, we consider these to be
INTERNAL ASSUMPIONS that should not be exposed through this module's public

    # PRESERVING DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMIZATIONS and RESTORING UPSTREAM VALUES
    #
    # For the full Content Libraries Relaunch, we would like to keep track of which customizable fields the user has
    # actually customized. The idea is: once an author has customized a customizable field....
    #
    #   - future upstream syncs will NOT blow away the customization,
    #   - but future upstream syncs WILL fetch the upstream values and tuck them away in a hidden field,
    #   - and the author can can revert back to said fetched upstream value at any point.
    #
    # Now, whether field is "customized" (and thus "revertible") is dependent on whether they have ever edited it.
    # To instrument this, we need to keep track of which customizable fields have been edited using a new XBlock field:
    # `downstream_customized`
    #
    # Implementing `downstream_customized` has proven difficult, because there is no simple way to keep it up-to-date
    # with the many different ways XBlock fields can change. The `.save()` and `.editor_saved()` methods are promising,
    # but we need to do more due diligence to be sure that they cover all cases, including API edits, import/export,
    # copy/paste, etc. We will figure this out in time for the full Content Libraries Relaunch (related ticket:
    # https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-authoring/issues/1317). But, for the Beta realease, we're going to
    # implement something simpler:
    #
    # - We fetch upstream values for customizable fields and tuck them away in a hidden field (same as above).
    # - If a customizable field DOES match the fetched upstream value, then future upstream syncs DO update it.
    # - If a customizable field does NOT the fetched upstream value, then future upstream syncs DO NOT update it.
    # - There is no UI option for explicitly reverting back to the fetched upstream value.
    #
    # For future reference, here is a partial implementation of what we are thinking for the full Content Libraries
    # Relaunch::

    #    downstream_customized = List(
    #        help=(
    #            "Names of the fields which have values set on the upstream block yet have been explicitly "
    #            "overridden on this downstream block. Unless explicitly cleared by the user, these customizations "
    #            "will persist even when updates are synced from the upstream."
