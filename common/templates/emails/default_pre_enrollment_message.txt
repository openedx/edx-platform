Hi there!

Thank you for enrolling in a Stanford Online course.  You are receiving this
email from the Stanford Online Team as a confirmation that you have
successfully enrolled in one of our online courses.  Your chosen course will
now appear on your Stanford Online (https://class.stanford.edu/dashboard)
dashboard.  As it has not yet started, you'll notice that it isn't yet possible
to access the course site.  Once the course begins, the course team will send
out a welcome email to everyone enrolled with more information.

For the time being, you can return to the course listing page at
https://class.stanford.edu/courses and click to access your course's About page
for more information, such as when the course will start, and what topics will
be covered in the course.

Have more questions?  Please visit the Help Center at
https://stanfordonline.zendesk.com/hc/en-us, or send the Stanford Online course
support team a message by clicking on the Help tab that displays on all
https://class.stanford.edu pages.

See you soon!
The Stanford Online Team
