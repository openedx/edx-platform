        List of user's CourseEnrollments, CourseOverviews preloaded if possible.

        We try to preload all CourseOverviews, which are usually lazily loaded
        as the .course_overview property. This is to avoid making an extra
        query for every enrollment when displaying something like the student
        dashboard. If some of the CourseOverviews are not found, we make no
        attempt to initialize them -- we just fall back to existing lazy-load
        behavior. The goal is to optimize the most common case as simply as
        possible, without changing any of the existing contracts.

        The name of this method is long, but was the end result of hashing out a
        number of alternatives, so pylint can stuff it (disable=invalid-name)
