    An endpoint for logging events using Segment's webhook integration.

    Segment provides a custom integration mechanism that initiates a request to a configurable URL every time an
    event is received by their system. This endpoint is designed to receive those requests and convert the events into
    standard tracking log entries.

    For now we limit the scope of handled events to track and screen events from mobile devices. In the future we could
    enable logging of other types of events, however, there is significant overlap with our non-Segment based event
    tracking. Given that Segment is closed third party solution we are limiting its required usage to just
    collecting events from mobile devices for the time being.

    Many of the root fields of a standard edX tracking event are read out of the "properties" dictionary provided by the
    Segment event, which is, in turn, provided by the client that emitted the event.

    In order for an event to be accepted and logged the "key" query string parameter must exactly match the django
    setting TRACKING_SEGMENTIO_WEBHOOK_SECRET. While the endpoint is public, we want to limit access to it to the
    Segment servers only.

    """

    # Validate the security token. We must use a query string parameter for this since we cannot customize the POST body
    # in the Segment webhook configuration, we can only change the URL that they call, so we force this token to be
    # included in the URL and reject any requests that do not include it. This also assumes HTTPS is used to make the
    # connection between their server and ours.

    Record an event received from Segment to the tracking logs.

    This method assumes that the event has come from a trusted source.

    The received event must meet the following conditions in order to be logged:

    * The value of the "type" field of the event must be included in the list specified by the django setting
      TRACKING_SEGMENTIO_ALLOWED_TYPES. In order to make use of *all* of the features Segment offers we would have
      to implement some sort of persistent storage of information contained in some actions (like identify). For now,
      we defer support of those actions and just support a limited set that can be handled without storing information
      in external state.
    * The value of the standard "userId" field of the event must be an integer that can be used to look up the user
      using the primary key of the User model.
    * Include a "name" field in the properties dictionary that indicates the edX event name. Note this can differ
      from the "event" field found in the root of a Segment event. The "event" field at the root of the structure is
      intended to be human readable, the "name" field is expected to conform to the standard for naming events
      found in the edX data documentation.
    * Have originated from a known and trusted Segment client library. The django setting
      TRACKING_SEGMENTIO_SOURCE_MAP maps the known library names to internal "event_source" strings. In order to be
      logged the event must have a library name that is a valid key in that map.

    Additionally the event can optionally:

    * Provide a "context" dictionary in the properties dictionary. This dictionary will be applied to the
      existing context on the server overriding any existing keys. This context dictionary should include a "course_id"
      field when the event is scoped to a particular course. The value of this field should be a valid course key. The
      context may contain other arbitrary data that will be logged with the event, for example: identification
      information for the device that emitted the event.
