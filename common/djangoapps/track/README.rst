Responsibilities
================
The Track app records student tracking events into logs for later analysis by Insights and academic research teams. It provides an endpoint for front end code to asynchronously send user tracking events, as well as providing middleware to record server calls.

While new event types are being added all the time, the Track app for recording those events is not under active development.
