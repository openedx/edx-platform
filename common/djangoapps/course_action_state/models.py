Models for course action state

If you make changes to this model, be sure to create an appropriate migration
file and check it in at the same time as your model changes. To do that,

1. Go to the edx-platform dir
2. ./manage.py cms schemamigration course_action_state --auto description_of_your_change
3. It adds the migration file to edx-platform/common/djangoapps/course_action_state/migrations/
