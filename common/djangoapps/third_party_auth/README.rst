Third Party Auth
----------------

This djangoapp provides the views and workflows for authenticating into edx-platform with third-party applications, including both OAuth and SAML workflows.

We make use of the `social-auth-app-django`_ as our backend library for this djangoapp.

To enable this feature, check out the `third party authentication documentation`.
