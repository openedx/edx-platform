"""
This module aims to give a little more fine-tuned control of caching and cache
invalidation. Import these instead of django.core.cache.

Note that 'default' is being preserved for user session caching, which we're
not migrating so as not to inconvenience users by logging them all out.

    Many of the pages in edX are identical when the user is not logged
    in, but should not be cached when the user is logged in (because
    of the navigation bar at the top with the username).

    The django middleware cache does not handle this correctly, because
    we access the session to put the csrf token in the header. This adds
    the cookie to the vary header, and so every page is cached seperately
    for each user (because each user has a different csrf token).

    Optionally, provide a series of GET parameters as arguments to cache
    pages with these GET parameters separately.

    Note that this decorator should only be used on views that do not
    contain the csrftoken within the html. The csrf token can be included
    in the header by ordering the decorators as such:
