):
    """
    Stores an uploaded file to django file storage.

    Args:
        request (HttpRequest): A request object from which a file will be retrieved.
        file_key (str): The key for retrieving the file from `request.FILES`. If no entry exists with this
            key, a `ValueError` will be thrown.
        allowed_file_types (list): a list of allowable file type extensions. These should start with a period
            and be specified in lower-case. For example, ['.txt', '.csv']. If the uploaded file does not end
            with one of these extensions, a `PermissionDenied` exception will be thrown. Note that the uploaded file
            extension does not need to be lower-case.
        base_storage_filename (str): the filename to be used for the stored file, not including the extension.
            The same extension as the uploaded file will be appended to this value.
        max_file_size (int): the maximum file size in bytes that the uploaded file can be. If the uploaded file
            is larger than this size, a `PermissionDenied` exception will be thrown.
        validator (function): an optional validation method that, if defined, will be passed the stored file (which
            is copied from the uploaded file). This method can do validation on the contents of the file and throw
            a `FileValidationException` if the file is not properly formatted. If any exception is thrown, the stored
            file will be deleted before the exception is re-raised. Note that the implementor of the validator function
            should take care to close the stored file if they open it for reading.

    Returns:
        Storage: the file storage object where the file can be retrieved from
        str: stored_file_name: the name of the stored file (including extension)
