Any place that says "YEAR_SEMESTER" needs to be replaced with something
in the form "2013_Spring". Take note of this name exactly, you'll need to
use it everywhere, precisely - capitalization is very important.

See https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/doc/xml-format.md for more on all this.
