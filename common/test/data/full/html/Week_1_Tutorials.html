    <h1>Week 1 Tutorials</h1>
    <section class="tutorials">
      <h2> Introduction </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/section/intro"> Welcome! </a> - We introduce
      ourselves and explain the tutorial format. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Basic Tutorials </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/section/circuit_abstraction">The Circuit
        Abstraction</a> - We look at a lightbulb, and see that abstracting
      away the circuit from the geometry of the wiring has no visible
      effect. </li>
        <li><a href="/section/a_real_circuit/">Lightbulb Circuit</a> - We
      look at the voltage across a lightbulb with a multimeter, and
      confirm the device is symmetric.  In the process, we see reference
      directions for currents, voltages, and polarity for powers. </li>
        <li><a href="/section/parallel_resistors">Parallel Resistors</a> -
      An explanation of equivalent circuits in the context of parallel
      resistors.</li>
        <li><a href="/section/series_and_parallel">Combination of Series
        and Parallel</a> - Slightly more complex networks of resistors
      simplified with equivalent networks.</li>
        <li><a href="/section/3r_nodal">Nodal Analysis</a> - A simple
      example of nodal analysis.</li>
        <li><a href="/section/floating_voltage_3r">Floating Voltage</a> -
      Nodal analysis with a floating source.</li>
        <li><a href="/section/combination_rules">Combination Rules</a> -
      We show how to apply combination rules to solving simple
      circuits.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Worked Problems </h2>
      <p> For the first week, we work through <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-002-circuits-and-electronics-spring-2007/assignments/hw1.pdf"> the first problem set from 2007</a></p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/section/exercise_1_1">OCW Exercise 1-1</a>: Find voltages in a simple series and parallel circuit, and show power is conserved</li>
        <li><a href="/section/ex_1_2">OCW Exercise 1-2</a> - Synthesize a network of 3/5k and 5/3k from at most four 1k resistors</li>
        <li><a href="/section/problem_1-1">OCW Problem 1-1/Textbook 2.7</a> - Find the current through a resistor in a network of resistors</li>
        <li><a href="/section/problem_1-2_part1">OCW Problem 1-2</a> - Analyze long chains of resistors (similar to transmission lines or R1R2 ladders) </li>
        <li><a href="/section/problem_1_3">OCW Problem 1-3 </a> - Reverse engineer a black-box resistor network</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>  Since the course has students from a diverse set of backgrounds, the first week's tutorials includes several extra segments, worked out with greater detail, to help bring everyone up to speed. </p>
