      	       <p><h3>Primary versus Secondary Updates:</h3> Unfortunately, the internet throws a lot of text at students, and they 
      	       do not read everything that they are given. However, many students <em>do</em> read all that they are
      	       given, and so detailed explainations in this section will benefit the most concientious.
      	       Any essential information should be extremely quickly summarized in the primary section for skimmers.</p>
      	       <p><h3>Star Forum Poster</h3>
      	       Students appriciate knowing that the course staff is reading what they post, and one of several ways
      	       that you can do this is by acknowledging the start posters in your announcements.
