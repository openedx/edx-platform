        \subsection{Problem With Adaptive Hint}

        % Adaptive hints are messages provided to students which depend on
        % student input.  These hints are produced using a script embedded
        % within the problem (written in Python).
        %
        % Here is an example.  This example uses LaTeX as a high-level
        % soure language for the problem.  The problem can also be coded
        % directly in XML.

        This problem demonstrates a question with hints, based on using the
        {\tt hintfn} method.

        \begin{edXscript}
        def test_str(expect, ans):
          print expect, ans
          ans = ans.strip("'")
          ans = ans.strip('"')
          return expect == ans.lower()

        def hint_fn(answer_ids, student_answers, new_cmap, old_cmap):
          aid = answer_ids[0]
          ans = str(student_answers[aid]).lower()
          print 'hint_fn called, ans=', ans
          hint = ''
          if 'java' in ans:
             hint = 'that is only good for drinking'
          elif 'perl' in ans:
             hint = 'not that rich'
          elif 'pascal' in ans:
             hint = 'that is a beatnick language'
          elif 'fortran' in ans:
             hint = 'those were the good days'
          elif 'clu' in ans:
             hint = 'you must be invariant'
          if hint:
            hint = "<font color='blue'>Hint: {0}</font>".format(hint)
            new_cmap.set_hint_and_mode(aid,hint,'always')
        \end{edXscript}

        enter your answer in upper or lower case, with or without quotes.
