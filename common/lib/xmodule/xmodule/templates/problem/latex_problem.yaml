        % Nearly any kind of edX problem can be authored using LaTeX as
        % the source language.  Write LaTeX as usual, including equations. The
        % key feature is the \edXabox{} macro, which specifies an "answer
        % box" that queries students for a response, and specifies what the
        % expected (correct) answer is.

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Example "option" problem}

        Which of the following countries celebrates its independence on August 15?

        \edXabox{options='India','Spain','China','Bermuda' expect='India'}

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Example "multiple choice" problem}

        Which of the following countries has the largest population?

        \edXabox{ type="multichoice" expect="Indonesia" options="Brazil","Germany","Indonesia","Russia" }

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Example "symbolic" problem}

        What is Einstein's equation for the energy equivalent of a mass $m$?

        \edXabox{type='symbolic' size='90' expect='m*c^2' }

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Example "numerical" problem}

        Estimate the energy savings (in J/y) if all the people
        ($3\times 10^8$) in the U.~S. switched from U.~S. code to low-flow
        shower heads.

        \edXinline{Energy saved = }\edXabox{expect="0.52" type="numerical" tolerance='0.02' inline='1' } %
        \edXinline{~EJ/year}

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Example "string response" problem}

        What was the first post-secondary school in China to allow both male and female students?

        \edXabox{ type="string" expect="Nanjing Higher Normal Institute" options="ci" }

        You can include an explanation of the answer by using the edXsolution
        macro. Click "Show Answer" to see the explanation.

        \begin{edXsolution}
        Nanjing Higher Normal Institute first admitted female students in 1920.
        \end{edXsolution}

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Example "custom response" problem}

        In this problem, a custom Python script determines if the answer is correct.

        \begin{edXscript}
        def sumtest(expect,ans):
            (a1,a2) = map(float,eval(ans))
            return (a1+a2)==10
        \end{edXscript}

        Enter a Python list of two numbers that sum to 10. For example, your answer might be [9,1] or [4,6].

        \edXabox{expect="[1,9]" type="custom" cfn="sumtest"}

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Example image}

        Include an image by using the following macro:

        \edXxml{<img src="https://courses.edx.org/static/images/placeholder-image.png"/>}

        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        \subsection{Example show/hide explanation}

        You can provide additional information that only appears at certain times by including a "showhide" flag.

        \edXshowhide{sh1}{More explanation}{This is a hidden explanation. It
        can contain equations, such as $\alpha = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1+\gamma}}$ }.

        This is additional text after the hidden explanation.
