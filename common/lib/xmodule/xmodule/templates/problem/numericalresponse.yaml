    markdown: |
       A numerical input problem accepts a line of text input from the
       student, and evaluates the input for correctness based on its
       numerical value.

       The answer is correct if it is within a specified numerical tolerance
       of the expected answer.

       Enter the numerical value of Pi:
       = 3.14159 +- .02
       
       Enter the approximate value of 502*9:
       = 4518 +- 15%

       Enter the number of fingers on a human hand:
       = 5

       [explanation]
       Pi, or the the ratio between a circle's circumference to its diameter, is an irrational number 
       known to extreme precision. It is value is approximately equal to 3.14.

       Although you can get an exact value by typing 502*9 into a calculator, the result will be close to 
       500*10, or 5,000. The grader accepts any response within 15% of the true value, 4518, so that you 
       can use any estimation technique that you like.

       If you look at your hand, you can count that you have five fingers.
