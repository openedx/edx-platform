      <p>
      In custom Python-evaluated input (also called "write-your-own-grader"
      problems), the grader uses a Python script that you create and embed in
      the problem to evaluate a learner's response or provide hints. These
      problems can be any type. Numerical input and text input problems are
      the most common write-your-own-grader problems.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can use script tag format or answer tag format to create these problems.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can create custom Python-evaluated input problems that provide
      partial credit or that randomize variables in the Python code. You can
      also add images to the solution by using an HTML "img" tag. Note that
      the "img" tag must be between the "div" tags that are inside the
      "solution" tags, and that learners do not see these images until they
      click the "Show Answer" button.
