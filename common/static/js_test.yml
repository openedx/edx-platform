# Regular expressions used to exclude *.js files from
# appearing in the test runner page.
# Files are included by default, which means that they
# are loaded using a <script> tag in the test runner page.
# When loading many files, this can be slow, so
# exclude any files you don't need.

#    - path/to/lib/include/exception_*.js

# Regular expression used to guarantee that a *.js file
# is included in the test runner page.
# If a file name matches both `exclude_from_page` and
# `include_in_page`, the file WILL be included.
# You can use this to exclude all files in a directory,
# but make an exception for particular files.
