# error codes: https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes
# E501: line too long
# E265: block comment should start with '# '
#   We ignore this because pep8 used to erroneously lump E266 into it also.
#   We should probably fix these now.
# E266: too many leading '#' for block comment
#   We have lots of comments that look like "##### HEADING #####" which violate
#   this rule, because they don't have a space after the first #. However,
#   they're still perfectly reasonable comments, so we disable this rule.
# W602: deprecated form of raising exception
#   We do this in a few places to modify the exception message while preserving
#   the traceback. See this blog post for more info:
#   http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200711/rethrowing_exceptions_in_python.html
#   It's a little unusual, but we have good reasons for doing so, so we disable
#   this rule.
# E203: whitespace before ':'
#   We ignore this because of black formatter defaults
# E305,E402,E722,E731,E741,E743,W503,W504: errors and warnings added since pep8/pycodestyle
# 1.5.7 that we haven't cleaned up yet
