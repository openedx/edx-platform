openedx
-------

This directory (openedx) should contain code that is used by both `LMS <https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/master/lms>`_ and `CMS <https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/master/cms>`_. If your code is specific to LMS or CMS, put it in those directories instead.

Like openedx, the directory `common <https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/master/common>`_ also contains code used by both LMS and CMS. At some point we'll merge the two.

Lastly, the directory `xmodule <https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/master/xmodule>`_ contains legacy core code, also used by both LMS and CMS. We're in the middle of a long process of phasing that code out. Don't add new code there.
