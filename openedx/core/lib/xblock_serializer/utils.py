    """
    Hack that makes some legacy XBlocks which inherit `XmlMixin.add_xml_to_node`
    instead of the usual `XmlSerialization.add_xml_to_node` serializable to a string.
    This is needed for the OLX export API.

    Originally, `add_xml_to_node` was `XModuleDescriptor`'s method and was migrated to `XmlMixin`
    as part of the content core platform refactoring. It differs from `XmlSerialization.add_xml_to_node`
    in that it relies on `XmlMixin.export_to_file` (or `CustomTagBlock.export_to_file`) method to control
    whether a block has to be exported as two files (one .olx pointing to one .xml) file, or a single XML node.

    For the legacy blocks (`AnnotatableBlock` for instance) `export_to_file` returns `True` by default.
    The only exception is `CustomTagBlock`, for which this method was originally developed, as customtags don't
    have to be exported as separate files.

    This method temporarily replaces a block's runtime's `export_fs` system with an in-memory filesystem.
    Also, it abuses the `XmlMixin.export_to_file` API to prevent the XBlock export code from exporting
    each block as two files (one .olx pointing to one .xml file).

    Although `XModuleDescriptor` has been removed a long time ago, we have to keep this hack untill the legacy
    `add_xml_to_node` implementation is removed in favor of `XmlSerialization.add_xml_to_node`, which itself
    is a hard task involving refactoring of `CourseExportManager`.
