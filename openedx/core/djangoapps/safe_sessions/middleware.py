"""
This module defines SafeSessionMiddleware that makes use of a
SafeCookieData that cryptographically binds the user to the session id
in the cookie.

The primary goal is to avoid and detect situations where a session is
corrupted and the client becomes logged in as the wrong user. This
could happen via cache corruption (which we've seen before) or a
request handling bug. It's unlikely to happen again, but would be a
critical issue, so we've built in some checks to make sure the user on
the session doesn't change over the course of the session or between
the request and response phases.

The secondary goal is to improve upon Django's session handling by
including cryptographically enforced expiration.

The implementation is inspired in part by the proposal in the paper
<http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf>
but deviates in a number of ways; mostly it just uses the technique
of an intermediate key for HMAC.

Note: The proposed protocol protects against replay attacks by
use of channel binding—specifically, by
incorporating the session key used in the SSL connection.  However,
this does not suit our needs since we want the ability to reuse the
same cookie over multiple browser sessions, and in any case the server
will be behind a load balancer and won't have access to the correct
SSL session information.  So instead, we mitigate
replay attacks by enforcing session cookie expiration
(via TimestampSigner) and assuming SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE (see below).

We use django's built-in Signer class, which makes use of a built-in
salted_hmac function that derives an intermediate key from the
server's SECRET_KEY, as proposed in the paper.

Note: The paper proposes deriving an intermediate key from the
session's expiration time in order to protect against volume attacks.
(Note that these hypothetical attacks would only succeed if HMAC-SHA1
were found to be weak, and there is presently no indication of this.)
However, since django does not always use an expiration time, we
instead use a random key salt to prevent volume attacks.

In fact, we actually use a specialized subclass of Signer called
TimestampSigner. This signer binds a timestamp along with the signed
data and verifies that the signature has not expired.  We do this
since django's session stores do not actually verify the expiration
of the session cookies.  Django instead relies on the browser to honor
session cookie expiration.

The resulting safe cookie data that gets stored as the value in the
session cookie is:

    version '|' session_id '|' key_salt '|' signed_hash

where signed_hash is a structure incorporating the following value and
a MAC (via TimestampSigner):

    SHA256(version '|' session_id '|' user_id '|')

TimestampSigner uses HMAC-SHA1 to derive a key from key_salt and the
server's SECRET_KEY; see django.core.signing for more details on the
structure of the output (which takes the form of colon-delimited
Base64.)

Note: We assume that the SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE setting is set to
TRUE to prevent inadvertent leakage of the session cookie to a
person-in-the-middle.  The SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE flag indicates
to the browser that the cookie should be sent only over an
SSL-protected channel.  Otherwise, a connection eavesdropper could copy
the entire cookie and use it to impersonate the victim.

Custom Attributes:
    safe_sessions.user_mismatch: 'request-response-mismatch' | 'request-session-mismatch'
        This attribute can be one of the above two values which correspond to the kind of comparison
        that failed when processing the response. See SafeSessionMiddleware._verify_user_and_log_mismatch
