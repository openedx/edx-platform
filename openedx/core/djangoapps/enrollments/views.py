        **GET Response Values**

            If an unspecified error occurs when the user tries to obtain a
            learner's enrollments, the request returns an HTTP 400 "Bad
            Request" response.

            If the user does not have permission to view enrollment data for
            the requested learner, the request returns an HTTP 404 "Not Found"
            response.

        **POST Response Values**

             If the user does not specify a course ID, the specified course
             does not exist, or the is_active status is invalid, the request
             returns an HTTP 400 "Bad Request" response.

             If a user who is not an admin tries to upgrade a learner's course
             mode, the request returns an HTTP 403 "Forbidden" response.

             If the specified user does not exist, the request returns an HTTP
             406 "Not Acceptable" response.

        **GET and POST Response Values**

            If the request is successful, an HTTP 200 "OK" response is
            returned along with a collection of course enrollments for the
            user or for the newly created enrollment.

            Each course enrollment contains the following values.

            * course_details: A collection that includes the following
              values.

                * course_end: The date and time when the course closes. If
                  null, the course never ends.

                * course_id: The unique identifier for the course.

                * course_name: The name of the course.

                * course_modes: An array of data about the enrollment modes
                  supported for the course. If the request uses the parameter
                  include_expired=1, the array also includes expired
                  enrollment modes.

                  Each enrollment mode collection includes the following
                  values.

                  * currency: The currency of the listed prices.

                  * description: A description of this mode.

                  * expiration_datetime: The date and time after which users
                    cannot enroll in the course in this mode.

                  * min_price: The minimum price for which a user can enroll in
                    this mode.

                  * name: The full name of the enrollment mode.

                  * slug: The short name for the enrollment mode.

                  * suggested_prices: A list of suggested prices for this
                    enrollment mode.

                * course_start: The date and time when the course opens. If
                  null, the course opens immediately when it is created.

                * enrollment_end: The date and time after which users cannot
                  enroll for the course. If null, the enrollment period never
                  ends.

                * enrollment_start: The date and time when users can begin
                  enrolling in the course. If null, enrollment opens
                  immediately when the course is created.

                * invite_only: A value indicating whether students must be
                  invited to enroll in the course. Possible values are true or
                  false.

             * created: The date the user account was created.

             * is_active: Whether the enrollment is currently active.
