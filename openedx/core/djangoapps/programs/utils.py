    NOTE: This method relies on the Program Cache right now. The goal is to move away from this
    in the future.

    Arguments:
        user (User): The user we are looking for.
        program_type_slug (str): The slug of the Program type we are looking for.
        paid_modes_only (bool): Request if the user is enrolled in a Program in a paid mode, False by default.
        enrollments (List[Dict]): Takes a serialized list of CourseEnrollments linked to the user
        entitlements (List[CourseEntitlement]): Take a list of CourseEntitlement objects linked to the user

        NOTE: Both enrollments and entitlements will be collected if they are not passed in. They are available
