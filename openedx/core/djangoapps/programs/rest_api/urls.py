Programs API URLs.

This is legacy URLs for the program dashboard API from when the legacy learner
dashboard existed.  Current-and-future advertised URLs for this API will be
under `api/learner_home`.  This is why there is a version numbering discrepancy.
While these will still be reachable from `/dashboard/v0/programs` for backward
compatibility, the API will now be part of `/learner_dashboard/v1/programs`.
