Responsibilities
================
The Credentials app is responsible (along with the `programs app`_)
for communicating with the `credentials service`_, which is
the system of record for a learner's Program Certificates, and which (when enabled by the edX
instance) is the system of record for accessing all of a learner's credentials.

.. _credentials service: https://github.com/openedx/credentials

.. _programs app: https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/master/openedx/core/djangoapps/programs
