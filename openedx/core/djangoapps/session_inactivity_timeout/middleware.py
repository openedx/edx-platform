"""
Middleware to auto-expire inactive sessions after N seconds, which is configurable in
settings.

To enable this feature, set in a settings.py:

  SESSION_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_IN_SECS = 300

This was taken from StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14830669/how-to-expire-django-session-in-5minutes)

If left unset, session expiration will be handled by Django's SESSION_COOKIE_AGE,
which defauts to 1209600 (2 weeks, in seconds).
