class CourseWaffleFlag(WaffleFlag):
    """
    Represents a single waffle flag that can be forced on/off for a course.

    This class should be used instead of WaffleFlag when in the context of a course.
    This class will also respect any org-level overrides, though course-level overrides will take precedence.

    Uses a cached waffle namespace.

    Usage:

       SOME_COURSE_FLAG = CourseWaffleFlag('my_namespace.some_course_feature', __name__, log_prefix='')

    And then we can check this flag in code with::

        SOME_COURSE_FLAG.is_enabled(course_key)

    To configure a course-level override, go to Django Admin "waffle_utils" -> "Waffle flag course overrides".

        Waffle flag: Set this to the flag name (e.g. my_namespace.some_course_feature).
        Course id: Set this to the course id (e.g. course-v1:edx+100+Demo)
        Override choice: (Force on/Force off). "Force on" will enable the waffle flag for all users in a course,
            overriding any behavior configured on the waffle flag itself. "Force off" will disable the waffle flag
            for all users in a course, overriding any behavior configured on the waffle flag itself. Requires
            "Enabled" (see below) to apply.
        Enabled: Must be marked as "enabled" in order for the override to be applied. These settings can't be
            deleted, so instead, you need to add another disabled override entry to disable the override.

    To configure an org-level override, go to Django Admin "waffle_utils" -> "Waffle flag org overrides".

        Waffle flag: Set this to the flag name (e.g. my_namespace.some_course_feature).
        Org name: Set this to the organization name (e.g. edx)
        Override choice: (Force on/Force off). "Force on" will enable the waffle flag for all users in an org's courses,
            overriding any behavior configured on the waffle flag itself. "Force off" will disable the waffle flag
            for all users in a org's courses, overriding any behavior configured on the waffle flag itself. Requires
            "Enabled" (see below) to apply.
        Enabled: Must be marked as "enabled" in order for the override to be applied. These settings can't be
            deleted, so instead, you need to add another disabled override entry to disable the override.
