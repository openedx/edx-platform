"""
Basic tests for dump_settings management command.

These are moreso testing that dump_settings works, less-so testing anything about the Django
settings files themselves. Remember that tests only run with (lms,cms)/envs/test.py,
which are based on (lms,cms)/envs/common.py, so these tests will not execute any of the
YAML-loading or post-processing defined in (lms,cms)/envs/production.py.
