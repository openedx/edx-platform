    Dump current Django settings to JSON for debugging/diagnostics.

    BEWARE: OUTPUT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CONSUMPTION BY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.
    The purpose of this output is to be *helpful* for a *human* operator to understand how their settings are being
    rendered and how they differ between different settings files. The serialization format is NOT perfect: there are
    certain situations where two different settings will output identical JSON. For example, this command does NOT:

    disambiguate between lists and tuples:
    * (1, 2, 3)  # <-- this tuple will be printed out as [1, 2, 3]
    * [1, 2, 3]

    disambiguate between sets and sorted lists:
    * {2, 1, 3}  # <-- this set will be printed out as [1, 2, 3]
    * [1, 2, 3]

    disambiguate between internationalized and non-internationalized strings:
    * _("hello") # <-- this will become just "hello"
    * "hello"

    Furthermore, functions and classes are printed as JSON objects like:
    {
        "module": "path.to.module",
        "qualname": "MyClass.MyInnerClass.my_method",  // Or, "<lambda>"
        "source_hint": "MY_SETTING = lambda: x + y",  // For <lambda>s only
    }

    And everything else will be stringified as its `repr(...)`.
