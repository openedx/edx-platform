Content Libraries Models
========================

This module contains the models for new Content Libraries.

LTI 1.3 Models
==============

Content Libraries serves learning-core-based content through LTI 1.3 launches.
The interface supports resource link launches and grading services.  Two use
cases justify the current data model to support LTI launches.  They are:

1. Authentication and authorization.  This use case demands management of user
   lifecycle to authorize access to content and grade submission, and it
   introduces a model to own the authentication business logic related to LTI.

2. Grade and assignments.  When AGS is supported, content libraries store
   additional information concerning the launched resource so that, once the
   grading sub-system submits the score, it can retrieve them to propagate the
   score update into the LTI platform's grade book.

Relationship with LMS's ``lti_provider``` models
------------------------------------------------

The data model above is similar to the one provided by the current LTI 1.1
implementation for modulestore and courseware content.  But, Content Libraries
is orthogonal.  Its use-case is to offer standalone, embedded content from a
specific backend (learning core).  As such, it decouples from LTI 1.1. and the
logic assume no relationship or impact across the two applications.  The same
reasoning applies to steps beyond the data model, such as at the XBlock
runtime, authentication, and score handling, etc.
