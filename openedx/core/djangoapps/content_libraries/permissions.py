class HasPermissionInContentLibraryScope(Rule):
    """Bridgekeeper rule that checks content library permissions via the openedx-authz system.

    This rule integrates the openedx-authz authorization system (backed by Casbin) with
    Bridgekeeper's declarative permission system. It checks if a user has been granted a
    specific permission (action) through their role assignments in the authorization system.

    The rule works by:
    1. Querying the authorization system to find library scopes where the user has this permission
    2. Parsing the library keys (org/slug) from the scopes
    3. Building database filters to match ContentLibrary models with those org/slug combinations

    This enables both individual object permission checks and efficient QuerySet
    filtering - a key feature that allows database-level filtering instead of
    checking each object individually.

    Attributes:
        action_external_key (str): The action/permission to check (e.g., 'view_library', 'edit_library').
            This should be the external key WITHOUT the namespace prefix.
            For example, use 'view_library' not 'act^view_library'.

        filter_keys (list[str]): The Django model fields to use when building QuerySet filters.
            Defaults to ['org', 'slug'] for ContentLibrary models.

            These fields are used to construct the Q object filters that match libraries
            based on the parsed components from library keys in authorization scopes.

            For ContentLibrary, library keys have the format 'lib:ORG:SLUG', which maps to:
            - 'org' -> filters on org__short_name (related Organization model)
            - 'slug' -> filters on slug field

            If filtering by different fields is needed, pass a custom list. For example:
            - ['org', 'slug'] - default for ContentLibrary (filters by org and slug)
            - ['id'] - filter by primary key (for other models)

    Examples:
        Basic usage with default filter_keys:
            >>> from bridgekeeper import perms
            >>> from openedx.core.djangoapps.content_libraries.permissions import HasPermissionInContentLibraryScope
            >>>
            >>> # Uses default filter_keys=['org', 'slug'] for ContentLibrary
            >>> can_view = HasPermissionInContentLibraryScope('view_library')
            >>> perms['libraries.view_library'] = can_view

        Compound permissions with boolean operators:
            >>> from bridgekeeper.rules import Attribute
            >>>
            >>> is_active = Attribute('is_active', True)
            >>> is_staff = Attribute('is_staff', True)
            >>> can_view = HasPermissionInContentLibraryScope('view_library')
            >>>
            >>> # User must be active AND (staff OR have explicit permission)
            >>> perms['libraries.view_library'] = is_active & (is_staff | can_view)

        QuerySet filtering (efficient, database-level):
            >>> from openedx.core.djangoapps.content_libraries.models import ContentLibrary
            >>>
            >>> # Gets all libraries user can view in a single SQL query
            >>> visible_libraries = perms['libraries.view_library'].filter(
            ...     request.user,
            ...     ContentLibrary.objects.all()
            ... )

        Individual object checks:
            >>> library = ContentLibrary.objects.get(org__short_name='DemoX', slug='CSPROB')
            >>> if perms['libraries.view_library'].check(request.user, library):
            ...     # User can view this specific library
            ...     return render_library(library)

    Note:
        The library keys in authorization scopes must have the format 'lib:ORG:SLUG'
        to match the ContentLibrary model's org.short_name and slug fields.
        For example, scope 'lib:DemoX:CSPROB' matches a library with
        org.short_name='DemoX' and slug='CSPROB'.
