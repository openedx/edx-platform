"""
Python API for content libraries
================================

Via ``views.py``, most of these API methods are also exposed as a REST API.

The API methods in this file are focused on authoring and specific to content
libraries; they wouldn't necessarily apply or work in other learning contexts
such as courses, blogs, "pathways," etc.

** As this is an authoring-focused API, all API methods in this file deal with
the DRAFT version of the content library.**

Some of these methods will work and may be used from the LMS if needed (mostly
for test setup; other use is discouraged), but some of the implementation
details rely on Studio so other methods will raise errors if called from the
LMS. (The REST API is not available at all from the LMS.)

Any APIs that use/affect content libraries but are generic enough to work in
other learning contexts too are in the core XBlock python/REST API at
``openedx.core.djangoapps.xblock.api/rest_api``.

For example, to render a content library XBlock as HTML, one can use the
generic:

    render_block_view(block, view_name, user)

That is an API in ``openedx.core.djangoapps.xblock.api`` (use it from Studio for
the draft version, from the LMS for published version).

There are one or two methods in this file that have some overlap with the core
XBlock API; for example, this content library API provides a
``get_library_block()`` which returns metadata about an XBlock; it's in this API
because it also returns data about whether or not the XBlock has unpublished
edits, which is an authoring-only concern.  Likewise, APIs for getting/setting
an individual XBlock's OLX directly seem more appropriate for small, reusable
components in content libraries and may not be appropriate for other learning
contexts so they are implemented here in the library API only.  In the future,
if we find a need for these in most other learning contexts then those methods
could be promoted to the core XBlock API and made generic.
