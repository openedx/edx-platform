    """
    Comprehensive theme aware CachedFilesMixin.
    Main purpose of subclassing CachedFilesMixin is to override the following methods.
    1 - _url
    2 - url_converter

    _url:
        This method takes asset name as argument and is responsible for adding hash to the name to support caching.
        This method is called during both collectstatic command and live server run.

        When called during collectstatic command that name argument will be asset name inside STATIC_ROOT,
        for non themed assets it will be the usual path (e.g. 'images/logo.png') but for themed asset it will
        also contain themes dir prefix (e.g. 'red-theme/images/logo.png'). So, here we check whether the themed asset
        exists or not, if it exists we pass the same name up in the MRO chain for further processing and if it does not
        exists we strip theme name and pass the new asset name to the MRO chain for further processing.

        When called during server run, we get the theme dir for the current site using `get_current_theme` and
        make sure to prefix theme dir to the asset name. This is done to ensure the usage of correct hash in file name.
        e.g. if our red-theme overrides 'images/logo.png' and we do not prefix theme dir to the asset name, the hash for
        '{platform-dir}/lms/static/images/logo.png' would be used instead of
        '{themes_base_dir}/red-theme/images/logo.png'

    url_converter:
        This function returns another function that is responsible for hashing urls that appear inside assets
        (e.g. url("images/logo.png") inside css). The method defined in the superclass adds a hash to file and returns
        relative url of the file.
        e.g. for url("../images/logo.png") it would return url("../images/logo.790c9a5340cb.png"). However we would
        want it to return absolute url (e.g. url("/static/images/logo.790c9a5340cb.png")) so that it works properly
        with themes.

        The overridden method here simply comments out the line that convert absolute url to relative url,
        hence absolute urls are used instead of relative urls.
