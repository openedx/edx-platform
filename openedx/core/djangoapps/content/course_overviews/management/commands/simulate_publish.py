"""
Many apps in the LMS maintain their own optimized data structures that they
update whenever a course publish is detected. To do this, they listen for the
SignalHandler.course_published signal. Sometimes we want to rebuild the data on
these apps regardless of an actual change in course content, either to recover
from a bug or to bootstrap a new app we're rolling out for the first time. To
date, each app has implemented its own management command for this kind of
bootstrapping work (e.g. generate_course_overviews, generate_course_blocks).

This management command will emit the SignalHandler.course_published signal for
some subset of courses and signal listeners, and then rely on existing listener
behavior to trigger the necessary data updates.
