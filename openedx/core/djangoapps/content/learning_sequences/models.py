"""
Models for Learning Sequences and Course Outline generation.

Conventions:

1. Only things in the `api` package should ever import this file. Do NOT import
from views.py or anywhere else. Even if that means we have to give up some DRF
niceties.

2. The vast majority of what our public API promises should be efficiently
queryable with these models. We might occasionally reach into other systems
built for fast course-level queries (e.g. grading, scheduling), but we should
never touch ModuleStore or Block Transformers.

3. It's okay for some basic validation to happen at the model layer. Constraints
like uniqueness should absolutely be enforced at this layer. But business logic
should happen in the `api` package.

4. Try to avoid blob-like entites (e.g. JSON fields) as much as possible and
push things into normalized tables.

5. In general, keep models as a thin, dumb persistence layer. Let the `api`
package decide when and where it's safe to cache things.

6. Models and data.py datastructures don't have to map 1:1, but the convention
is that the data struct has a "...Data" appended to it. For instance,
LearningContext -> LearningContextData. This is because the Python name for
dataclasses (what attrs is close to), and for better backwards compatibility if
we want to adopt this convention elsewhere.

7. Strongly separate things that are intrinsic to Learning Sequences as a whole
vs. things that only apply to Sequences in the context of a Course. We have
other uses for sequences (e.g. Content Libraries, Pathways) and we want to keep
that separated.

8. Your app _may_ make foreign keys to models in this app, but you should limit
yourself to the LearningContext and LearningSequence models. Other tables are
not guaranteed to stick around, and values may be deleted unexpectedly.

class UserPartitionGroup(models.Model):

    Each row represents a Group in a UserPartition.

    UserPartitions is a pluggable interface. Some IDs are static (with values
    less than 100). Others are dynamic, picking a range between 100 and 2^31-1.
    That means that technically, we could use IntegerField instead of
    BigIntegerField, but a) that limit isn't actually enforced as far as I can
    tell; and b) it's not _that_ much extra storage, so I'm using BigInteger
    instead (2^63-1).

    It's a pluggable interface (entry points: openedx.user_partition_scheme,
    openedx.dynamic_partition_generator), so there's no "UserPartition" model.
    We need to actually link this against the values passed back from the
    partitions service in order to map them to names and descriptions.

    Any CourseSection or CourseSectionSequence may be associated with any number
    of UserPartitionGroups. An individual _user_ may only be in one Group for
    any given User Partition, but a piece of _content_ can be associated with
    multiple groups. So for instance, for the Enrollment Track user partition,
    a piece of content may be associated with both "Verified" and "Masters"
    tracks, while a user may only be in one or the other.

    UserPartitionGroups are not associated with LearningSequence directly
    because User Partitions often carry course-level assumptions (e.g.
    Enrollment Track) that don't make sense outside of a Course.

    teams. In many cases, this will be some malformed course structure that gets
    uploaded via OLX import–a process that is more forgiving than Studio's UI.

    It's a little weird to store errors in such a freeform manner like this. It
    would be more efficient and flexible in terms of i18n if we were to store
    error codes, and leave the message generation to the time of display. The
    problem with that is that we don't know up front what the parameterization

    fairly complicated and include references to multiple attributes of multiple
    pieces of content with supporting breadcrumbs. Other future errors might
    just be about display_name string length.

    So instead of trying to model all that internally, I'm just allowing for
    freeform messages. It is quite possible that at some point we will come up
