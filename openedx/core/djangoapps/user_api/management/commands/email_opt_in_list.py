"""Generate a list indicating whether users have opted in or out of receiving email from an org.

Email opt-in is stored as an org-level preference.
When reports are generated, we need to handle:

1) Org aliases: some organizations might have multiple course key "org" values.
    We choose the most recently set preference among all org aliases.
    Since this information isn't stored anywhere in edx-platform,
    the caller needs to pass in the list of orgs and aliases.

2) No preference set: Some users may not have an opt-in preference set
    if they enrolled before the preference was introduced.
    These users are opted in by default.

3) Restricting to a subset of courses in an org: Some orgs have courses
    that we don't want to include in the results (e.g. EdX-created test courses).
    Allow the caller to explicitly specify the list of courses in the org.

The command will always use the read replica database if one is configured.
