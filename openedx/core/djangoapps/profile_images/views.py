class ProfileImageView(DeveloperErrorViewMixin, APIView):
    """
    **Use Cases**

        Add or remove profile images associated with user accounts.

        The requesting user must be signed in.  Users can only add profile
        images to their own account.  Users with staff access can remove
        profile images for other user accounts.  All other users can remove
        only their own profile images.

    **Example Requests**

        POST /api/user/v1/accounts/{username}/image

        DELETE /api/user/v1/accounts/{username}/image

    **Example POST Responses**

        When the requesting user attempts to upload an image for their own
        account, the request returns one of the following responses:

        * If the upload could not be performed, the request returns an HTTP 400
          "Bad Request" response with information about why the request failed.

        * If the upload is successful, the request returns an HTTP 204 "No
          Content" response with no additional content.

        If the requesting user tries to upload an image for a different
        user, the request returns one of the following responses:

        * If no user matches the "username" parameter, the request returns an
          HTTP 404 "Not Found" response.

        * If the user whose profile image is being uploaded exists, but the
          requesting user does not have staff access, the request returns an
          HTTP 404 "Not Found" response.

        * If the specified user exists, and the requesting user has staff
          access, the request returns an HTTP 403 "Forbidden" response.

    **Example DELETE Responses**

        When the requesting user attempts to remove the profile image for
        their own account, the request returns one of the following
        responses:

        * If the image could not be removed, the request returns an HTTP 400
          "Bad Request" response with information about why the request failed.

        * If the request successfully removes the image, the request returns
          an HTTP 204 "No Content" response with no additional content.

        When the requesting user tries to remove the profile image for a
        different user, the view will return one of the following responses:

        * If the requesting user has staff access, and the "username" parameter
          matches a user, the profile image for the specified user is deleted,
          and the request returns an HTTP 204 "No Content" response with no
          additional content.

        * If the requesting user has staff access, but no user is matched by
          the "username" parameter, the request returns an HTTP 404 "Not Found"
          response.

        * If the requesting user does not have staff access, the request
          returns an HTTP 404 "Not Found" response, regardless of whether
          the user exists or not.
