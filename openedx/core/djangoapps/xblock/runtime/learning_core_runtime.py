    FieldData for the Learning Core XBlock Runtime

    LearningCoreFieldData only supports the ``content`` and ``settings`` scopes.
    Any attempt to read or write fields with other scopes will raise a
    ``NotImplementedError``. This class does NOT support the parent and children
    scopes.

    LearningCoreFieldData should only live for the duration of one request. The
    interaction between LearningCoreXBlockRuntime and LearningCoreFieldData is
    as follows:

    1. LearningCoreXBlockRuntime knows how retrieve authored content data from
       the Learning Core APIs in openedx-learning. This content is stored as
       OLX, and LearningCoreXBlockRuntime won't know how to parse it into
       fields, since serialization logic can happen in the XBlock itself.
    2. LearningCoreXBlockRuntime will then invoke the block to parse the OLX and
       then force_save its field data into LearningCoreFieldData.
    3. After this point, various handler and API calls might alter fields for
       a given block using the XBlock.
    4. The main thing that LearningCoreXBlockRuntime will want to know later on
       is whether it needs to write any changes when its save_block method is
       invoked. To support this, LearningCoreFieldData needs to track which
       blocks have changes to any of their fields. See the marked_unchanged
       method docstring for more details.

        This is called by the XBlockRuntime superclass in the .runtime module.

        Implementation Details
        ----------------------
        The standard XBlock "static/{asset_path}" substitution strips out the
        leading "static/" part because it assumes that all files will exist in a
        shared, flat namespace (i.e. a course's Files and Uploads).

        Learning Core treats assets differently. Each Component has its own,
        isolated namespace for asset storage. Furthermore, that namespace
        contains content that are not meant to be downloadable, like the
        block.xml (the OLX of the Component). There may one day be other files
        that are not meant to be externally downloadable there as well, like
        Markdown or LaTeX source files or grader code.

        By convention, the static assets that we store in Learning Core and are
        meant for download sit inside a static/ directory that is local to each
        Component (and actually separate for each Component Version).

        So the transformation looks like this:

        1. The Learning Core ComponentVersion has an asset stored as
           ``static/test.png`` in the database.
        2. The original OLX content we store references ``/static/test.png``,
           per OLX convention. Note the leading "/".
        3. The ReplaceURLService XBlock runtime service invokes
           ``static_replace`` and strips out ``/static/``.
        4. The method we're in now is invoked with a ``static_path`` of just
           ``test.png``, because that's the transformation that works for
           ModuleStore-based courses, where everything is stored in the root of
           a shared Files and Uploads space.
        5. This method then builds a URL that re-adds the "static/" prefix, and
           then points to the ComponentVersion-specific location for that asset.

        Note: This means that the URL for a static asset will change with every
        new version of the Component that is created, i.e. with every edit
        that's saved–even if the asset itself doesn't change. This was the
        tradeoff we made in order to put each version's assets in an isolated
        space, and to make sure that we don't break things like relative links.
        On the backend, we only store the asset once.

        Performance Note
        ----------------
        This can theoretically get very expensive if there are many, many static
        asset references in a Component. It's also very cacheable–we could put
        it in a RequestCache with a key of (usage_key, version_num), and have
        the value be the component_version.uuid and the full list of assets. I'm
        not doing this yet in order to keep the code simpler, but I'm leaving
        this note here in case someone needs to optimize this later.
