# Generated migration for MariaDB UUID field conversion (Django 5.2)
"""
Migration to convert UUIDField from char(32) to uuid type for MariaDB compatibility.

This migration is necessary because Django 5 changed the behavior of UUIDField for MariaDB
databases from using CharField(32) to using a proper UUID type. This change isn't managed
automatically, so we need to generate migrations to safely convert the columns.

This migration only executes for MariaDB databases and is a no-op for other backends.
