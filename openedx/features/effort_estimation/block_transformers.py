    A transformer that adds effort estimation to the block tree.

    There are two fields added by this transformer:
    - effort_activities: The number of "activities" at this block or lower. Note that verticals count as a single
                         activity at most. Activities are basically anything that isn't text or video.
    - effort_time: Our best guess at how long the block and lower will take, in seconds. We use an estimated reading
                   speed and video duration to calculate this. Just a rough guide.

    If there is any missing data (like no video duration), we don't provide any estimates at all for the course.
    We'd rather provide no estimate than a misleading estimate.

    This transformer requires data gathered during the collection phase (from a course publish), so it won't work
    on a course until the next publish.
