This will run tests on all XBlocks in the `xblock.test.v0`
entrypoint. Did you notice something about that entry point? It ends
with a v0. That means this is not finished. At some point, we might
stop running v0 tests, replacing them with test case failures, and
run v1 tests only.

That be the dragon here.

    This exception is shown if there are multiple entry points with the same
    class name for a test. In most cases, this means you have two versions
    of the same XBlock installed, or two XBlocks with namespace collisions. In
    either case, it'd be nice to resolve (likely by renaming tests as they
    come in, hopefully still being careful to catch collisions which might
    effect deployed XBlocks. See discussion at:
      https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/pull/11032#discussion_r48097392).

    This means you have an entry point for a test that does not correspond
    to a properly named test class. For example, if you cut-and-paste entry
    points in `setup.py`, and forgot to repoint the class (so it points to
    `DoneXBlock` instead of `TestDone`), or otherwise made an error, you
    will see this exception.
