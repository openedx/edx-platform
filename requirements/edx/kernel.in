# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
# Please follow these guidelines whenever you change this file:
#
# 1. When adding a new dependency:
#    * add a comment to the end of the line explaining why it is needed.
#    * verify that the dependency has a license compatible with AGPLv3
#    * confirm that it has no system requirements beyond what we already install
#    * run "make upgrade" to update the detailed requirements files
# 2. Do not pin exact versions unless absolutely necessary.  When upgrading
#    an already-pinned package to its latest release, remove the version pin.
# 3. Do not add indirect dependencies unless a version constraint is needed to
#    avoid versions which have known problems.
# 4. If the package is not strictly necessary for the platform to run, add it to
#    another file such as bundled.in, development.in, or testing.in instead.
