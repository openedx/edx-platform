# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
#
# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should notify:
#   * @mollydb - to check licensing
#   * @edx/devops - to check system requirements

# This needs to be installed *after* lxml, which is in base.txt.
# python-saml pulls in lxml as a dependency, and due to a bug in setuptools,
# trying to compile lxml as a dependency causes setuptools to go into an
# infinite loop and run out of memory. Because why would you trust a
# dependency management tool to manage dependencies for you?
python-saml==2.1.3
