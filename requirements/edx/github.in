# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
#
# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should:
#   * verify that the dependency has a license compatible with AGPLv3
#   * confirm that it has no system requirements beyond what we already install
#   * run "make upgrade" to update the detailed requirements files
#
# Do *NOT* install Python packages from GitHub unless it's absolutely necessary!
# "I don't have time to add automatic Travis upload to PyPI." is *not* an
# acceptable excuse. Non-wheel module installations slow down the dev/building process.
# Travis/PyPI instructions are here:
# https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenOPS/pages/41911049/Publishing+a+Package+to+PyPI+using+Travis
#
# A correct GitHub reference looks like this:
#
#   git+https://github.com/OWNER/REPO-NAME.git@TAG-OR-SHA#egg=DIST-NAME==VERSION
#
# For example:
#
#   git+https://github.com/openedx/edx-lint.git@v0.3.2#egg=edx_lint==0.3.2
#
# where:
#
#   OWNER = edx
#   REPO-NAME = edx-lint
#   TAG-OR-SHA = v0.3.2
#   DIST-NAME = edx_lint
#   VERSION = 0.3.2
#
#
# Rules to follow (even though many URLs here don't follow them!):
#
#   * Don't leave out any of these pieces.
#
#   * TAG-OR-SHA is the specific commit to install.  It must be a git tag,
#     or a git SHA commit hash.  Don't use branch names here.  If OWNER is
#     not an edX organization, then it must be a SHA.  If you use a SHA,
#     please make sure there is a tag associated with it, so the commit can't
#     be lost during rebase.
#
#   * DIST-NAME is the distribution name, the same name you'd use in a
#     "pip install" command.  It might be different than REPO-NAME. It must
#     be the same as the `name="DIST-NAME"` value in the repo's setup.py.
#
#   * VERSION might not be the same as TAG-OR-SHA, but if the tag names the
#     version, please make it match the VERSION, but with a "v" prefix.
#     VERSION must be the same as the `version="VERSION"` value in the repo's
#     setup.py.  An alternative is to use 0.0 as VERSION: this forces pip to
#     re-install the package each time, and can be useful when working with two
#     repos before picking a version number. Don't use 0.0 on master, only for
#     tight-loop work in progress.
