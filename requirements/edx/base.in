# Core dependencies for running edx-platform (LMS or Studio)
#
# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
#
# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should:
#   * verify that the dependency has a license compatible with AGPLv3
#   * confirm that it has no system requirements beyond what we already install
#   * run "make upgrade" to update the detailed requirements files
#

-c ../constraints.txt

-r ../edx-sandbox/shared.txt  # Dependencies which are also used by code sandboxes
-r github.in              # Forks and other dependencies not yet on PyPI
-r local.in               # Packages in edx-platform which have their own setup.py
-r paver.txt              # Requirements for running paver commands

# Please follow these guidelines whenever you change this file:
#
# 1. When adding a new dependency, add a comment to the end of the line
#    explaining why it is needed.
# 2. Do not pin exact versions unless absolutely necessary.  When upgrading
#    an already-pinned package to its latest release, remove the version pin.
# 3. Do not add indirect dependencies unless a version constraint is needed to
#    avoid versions which have known problems.
# 4. If the package is not needed in production, add it to another file such
#    as development.in or testing.in instead.
