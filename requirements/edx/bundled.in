# Dependencies that are normally "bundled" with the platform, but are not core to the platform's functionality.
# They may still be installed by default, but they should not be required for
# the platform to run nor for the test suite to pass.
#
# We are working to make the test suite run without having these installed - see
# https://discuss.openedx.org/t/a-minimal-open-edx-distribution/9478
#
# Please follow these guidelines whenever you change this file:
#
# 1. When adding a new dependency:
#    * verify that the dependency has a license compatible with AGPLv3
#    * add a comment to the end of the line explaining what it is.
#    * confirm that it has no system requirements beyond what we already install
#    * run "make upgrade" to update the detailed requirements files
# 2. Do not pin exact versions unless absolutely necessary.  When upgrading
#    an already-pinned package to its latest release, remove the version pin.
# 3. Do not add indirect dependencies unless a version constraint is needed to
#    avoid versions which have known problems.
# 4. If the package is not needed in production, add it to another file such
#    as development.in or testing.in instead.
