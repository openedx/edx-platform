# This requirements file is only for python packages that need to be installed
# for the edx-platform in testing environments. This includes:
#   * Jenkins
#   * devstack
# Please do not use this file for packages that are needed in production
#
# DON'T JUST ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES!!!
#
# If you open a pull request that adds a new dependency, you should:
#   * verify that the dependency has a license compatible with AGPLv3
#   * confirm that it has no system requirements beyond what we already install
#   * run "make upgrade" to update the detailed requirements files
#   * add an appropriate pattern to scripts/dependencies/testing.py
