# These requirements are needed by both paver.txt and base.txt currently.
# When tox builds an environment with multiple requirements files and finds
# the same package listed multiple times, it'll fail to build the tox environment.
# Using a common base requirements file and '-r' including it in other files
# works around the tox issue.
#
# We plan to move edx-platform to use pip-tools soon and each target will have its
# own requirements files built, which will remove the need for this file.
