# Version constraints for pip-installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints

# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.
