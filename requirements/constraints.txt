# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.


# This file contains all common constraints for edx-repos
-c common_constraints.txt

# celert>5.0.0 hasn't been tested yet, so the constraint will be removed after testing latest version

# for them.
edx-enterprise==3.39.0

# Newer versions need a more recent version of python-dateutil
freezegun==0.3.12

# 4.5.1 introduced a bug when used together with xmlsec: https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1880251
# Tests passed, but hit a problem in stage
lxml<4.5.1

# oauthlib>3.0.1 causes test failures ( also remove the django-oauth-toolkit constraint when this is fixed )

# matplotlib>=3.4.0 requires python-dateutil>=2.7
matplotlib<3.4.0
# pandas>0.22.0 requires python-dateutil>=2.5.0
pandas==0.22.0
# networkx>=2.6 requires pandas>=1.1
networkx<2.6

# Constraint from astroid 2.3.3
wrapt==1.11.*

# tests failing for pymongo==3.11
pymongo<3.11

# sympy latest version causing test failures.
# may be related to python35 version drop in 1.7.0. Needs to be tested before removing.
sympy==1.6.2

# python3-saml==1.10.0 version started breaking a11y tests
python3-saml<1.10.0

# With greater version these tests `common.djangoapps.terrain.stubs.tests` becomes flaky on jenkins.

# latest version of diff-cover conflicts with pygments version see https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff_cover/commit/01f91760321cee1ad28cfa0d801c4acd8b9765a6

edxval<2.1

# At the time of writing this comment, we do not know whether py2neo>=2022
