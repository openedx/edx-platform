# Version constraints for pip-installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints

# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# Generally speaking, the major version of django-stubs must either match the major version
# of django, or exceed it by 1. So, we will need to perpetually constrain django-stubs and
# update it as we perform django upgrades. For more details, see:

# including the note on "Partial Support".

# social-auth-app-django 5.4.2 introduces a new migration that will not play nicely with large installations. This will touch

# lxml and xmlsec need to be constrained because the latest version builds against a newer
# version of libxml2 than what we're running with.  This leads to a version mismatch error
# at runtime.  You can re-produce it by running any test.
# If lxml is pinned in the future and you see this error, it may be that the system libxml2
# is now shipping the correct version and we can un-pin this.
