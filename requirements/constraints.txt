# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# Release 2.1.0 pulls declares `pact-python` as a base requirement, even though it should be
# a testing requirement. Installing it would cause a bunch of new tool packages to become base

edxval<2.1

# At the time of writing this comment, we do not know whether py2neo>=2022

# mistune is a dependency of m2r (which is a dependency of sphinxcontrib-openapi)
# m2r fails to specify the version of mistune that it needs leading to the error message:
# AttributeError: module 'mistune' has no attribute 'BlockGrammar'
# See Issue: https://github.com/miyakogi/m2r/issues/66
# m2r is no longer actively maintained: https://github.com/miyakogi/m2r/pull/43

# See issue: https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/openapi/issues/123
mistune<2.0.0

# django-celery-results==2.3.0 requires psycopg2 as dependency but hasn't explicitly added in package requirements.

# new version hasn't been released yet with the fix so pinning the version until django-celery-results>2.3.0 is out.
