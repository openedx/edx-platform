# This is a temporary solution to override the real common_constraints.txt
# In edx-lint, until the pyjwt constraint in edx-lint has been removed.
# See BOM-2721 for more details.
# Below is the copied and edited version of common_constraints

# A central location for most common version constraints
# (across edx repos) for pip-installation.
#
# Similar to other constraint files this file doesn't install any packages.
# It specifies version constraints that will be applied if a package is needed.
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why it is a good
# idea to pin this package across all edx repos, Ideally, link to other information
# that will help people in the future to remove the pin when possible.
# Writing an issue against the offending project and linking to it here is good.
#
# Note: Changes to this file will automatically be used by other repos, referencing
#  this file from Github directly. It does not require packaging in edx-lint.

# to this effort. Additionally, your IDA/service may also be affected directly
# by these changes. You should not upgrade without knowing what you are doing.
