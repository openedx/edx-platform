"""
Defines a CLI for compiling Sass (both default and themed) into CSS.

Should be run from the root of edx-platform using `npm run` wrapper.
Requirements for this scripts are stored in requirements/edx/assets.in.

Get more details:

     npm run compile-sass -- --help
     npm run compile-sass -- --dry

Setup (Tutor and Devstack will do this for you):

    python -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements/edx/assets.txt

Usage:

     npm run compile-sass             # prod, no args
     npm run compile-sass -- ARGS     # prod, with args
     npm run compile-sass-dev         # dev, no args
     npm run compile-sass-dev -- ARGS # dev, with args

This script is intentionally implemented in a very simplistic way. It prefers repetition
over abstraction, and its dependencies are minimal (just click and libsass-python, ideally).
We do this because:

* If and when we migrate from libsass-python to something less ancient like node-sass or dart-sass,
  we will want to re-write this script in Bash or JavaScript so that it can work without any
  backend tooling. By keeping the script dead simple, that will be easier.

* The features this script supports (legacy frontends & comprehensive theming) are on the way out,
  in favor of micro-frontends, branding, and Paragon design tokens. We're not sure how XBlock
  view styling will fit into that, but it probably can be much simpler than comprehensive theming.
  So, we don't need this script to be modular and extensible. We just need it to be obvious, robust,
  and easy to maintain until we can delete it.

See docs/decisions/0017-reimplement-asset-processing.rst for more details.

        IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
        =====================

        libsass is a C++ library for compiling Sass (ref: https://github.com/sass/libsass).

        libsass-python is a small PyPI package wrapping libsass, including:
          * The `_sass` module, which provides direct Python bindings for the C++ library.
            (ref: https://github.com/sass/libsass-python/blob/0.10.0/pysass.cpp)
          * The `sass` module, which adds some friendly Pythonic wrapper functions around `_sass`,
            notably `sass.compile_dirname(...)`.
            (ref: https://github.com/sass/libsass-python/blob/0.10.0/sass.py#L198-L201)

        Our legacy Sass code only works with a super old version of libsass (3.3.2,) which is provided to us by a super
        old version of libsass-python (0.10.0). In this super old libsass-python version:
          * the `sass` module DOESN'T support Python 3.11+, but
          * the `_sass` module DOES support Python 3.11+.

        Upgrading our Sass to work with newer a libsass version would be arduous and would potentially break
        comprehensive themes, so we don't want to do that. Forking libsass-python at v0.10.0 and adding Python 3.11+
        support would mean adding another repo to the openedx org. Rather than do either of those, we've decided to
        hack around the problem by just reimplementing what we need of `sass.compile_dirname` here, directly on top
        of the `_sass` C++ binding module.

        Eventually, we may eschew libsass-python altogether by switching to SassC@3.3.2, a direct CLI for libsass@3.3.2.
        (ref: https://github.com/sass/sassc). This would be nice because it would allow us to remove Python from the
        Sass build pipeline entirely. However, it would mean explicitly compiling & installing both libsass and SassC
        within the edx-platform Dockerfile, which has its own drawbacks.
