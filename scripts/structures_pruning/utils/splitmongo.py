"""
This module provides logic to clean up old, unused course content data for the
DraftVersioningModuleStore modulestore, more commonly referred to as the "Split
Mongo" or "Split" modulestore (DraftVersioningModuleStore subclasses
SplitMongoModuleStore). All courses and assets that have newer style locator
keys use DraftVersioningModuleStore. These keys start with "course-v1:",
"ccx-v1:", or "block-v1:".

The older modulestore is DraftModuleStore, sometimes called "Old Mongo". This
code does not address that modulestore in any way. That modulestore handles
courses that use the old "/" separator, such as "MITx/6.002x/2012_Spring", as
well as assets starting with "i4x://".

"Split" gets its name from the fact that it separates the Structure of a course
from the content in the leaf nodes. In theory, the Structure is an outline of
the course that contains all the parent/child relations for different content
blocks (chapters, sections, sub-sections, verticals, videos, etc.), as well as
small, commonly inherited metadata like due dates. More detailed information
about any particular block of content is stored in a separate collection as
Definitions.

Both Structures and Definitions are immutable in Split. When a course is edited,
a new Structure is created, and the Active Versions entry for a course is
updated to point to that new Structure. In that way, we never get a partially
applied edit -- it either succeeds or fails atomically. The Active Versions
entry for a Course has pointers to "published" and "draft" Structures. There is
also a special "library" pointer that is only used by Content Libraries. We do
not need to distinguish between these for the purposes of cleanup.

The problem is that Structure documents have become far larger than they were
intended to be, and we never created code to properly clean them up. As such, it
is not uncommon for the majority of Mongo storage space to be used by old
Structure documents that are completely unused (and are unreachable) by LMS or
Studio.

This module provides cleanup functionality with various tweakable options for
how much history to preserve. For simplicity, it reads all Structure IDs into
memory instead of working on subsets of the data. As a practical matter, this
means that it will work for databases with up to about 10 million Structures
before RAM usage starts to become a problem.

        Active Structures, walk back through the ancestors, and add all the

        know that we can delete all other structures without worrying about
        whether those Structures are reachable or knowing what their
        relationships are. This keeps things simpler, and means that we should
        be more resilient to failures when pruning.

        Structure documents exist in chains of parent/child relationships,
        starting with an Original Structure, having some number of Intermediate
        Structures, and ending in an Active Structure::

          Original -> (Intermediate 1) -> (Intermediate 2) -> ... -> Active

        Pruning Rules:

        1. All Active Structures must be preserved, as those are being used by
           the LMS and Studio to serve course content.

        2. All Original Structures should be preserved, since those are used by
           the LMS and Studio to determine common shared ancestry between
           Structures.

        3. Up to `num_intermediate_structures` Intermediate Structures will be
           kept. These Structures are not actually used in edx-platform code,
           but they are sometimes used by developers to allow emergency reverts
           in course team support situations (e.g. someone accidentally wiped
           out their course with a bad import).

        4. The oldest preserved Intermediate Structure will be modified so that
           its `previous_id` is updated to point to the Original Structure. That
           way, we're not preserving references to the IDs of Structures that

        Return StructuresGraph for the entire modulestore.

        `batch_size` is the number of structure documents we pull at a time.
        `delay` is the delay in seconds between batch queries.

        This has one slight complication. A StructuresGraph is expected to be a
        consistent view of the database, but MongoDB doesn't offer a "repeatable
        read" transaction isolation mode. That means that Structures may be
        added at any time between our database calls. Because of this, we have
        to be careful in stitching together something that is safe. The
        guarantees we try to make about the StructuresGraph being returned are:

          1. Every Structure ID in `active_structure_ids` is also in `structures`
          2. If `branches` is stale and there is a new Structure that is Active
             in the database, it is *not* in `structures`.

        Scenario A: We fetch branches, then structures
          1. Get Branches (and thus Active Structure IDs)
          2. New Structures created by Studio
          3. Get all Structures

        It is almost certainly the case that the new Structures created in (2)
        should be active. Our algorithm works by starting from the Active
        Structure IDs that we know about, making a "save" list, and then
        deleting all other Structures. The problem in this scenario is that we
        fetch the new Structures in (3), but we don't know that they're Active
        because our `active_structure_ids` comes from (1) and is stale. So we
        would in fact delete what should be Active Structures.

        Scenario B: We fetch structures, then branches
          1. Get all Structures
          2. New Structures created by Studio
          3. Get Branches (and thus Active Structure IDs)

        In this scenario, we may see Active Structure IDs that are not in
        our Structures dict. This is bad because we won't know how to crawl
        their ancestry and mark the appropriate Structure IDs to be saved.

        So the approach we take is Scenario B with a fallback. After we fetch
        everything, we go through the Active Structure IDs and make sure that
        those Structures and their ancestors exist in `structures`. If they
        don't, we make extra fetches to get them. Misses should be rare, so it
        shouldn't have a drastic performance impact overall.

        Note that it's safe if the ChangePlan as a whole is a little stale, so
        long as it's internally consistent. We only ever delete Structures that
        are in the `structures` doc, so a new Active Version that we're
        completely unaware of will be left alone.
