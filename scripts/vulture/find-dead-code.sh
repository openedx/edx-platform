# find-dead-code.sh
#
# This script analyzes the edx-platform for dead code instances using
# vulture, a static analysis tool that ranks potential unused code using
# the following confidence scores:
# - 100% = completely unreachable code: code that follows return, continue
#          or raise statements, or code that cannot logically be run, i.e.
#          a condition that can never be True
# - 90%  = unused imports within a file
# - 60%  = unused code: code that has no reference in the code base, aside
#          from definition
#
# This script will output a list of dead-code instances with their
# confidence scores, in descending order of the size of the instance
# (in lines). This in turn can be used to clean up the edx-platform.
# However, you shouldn't automatically delete code reported back from
# vulture. It can report false positives. Often it's not the case that
# code is truly dead, but has been referenced incorrectly (spelling)
# elsewhere in the code base, most likely in a refactor. Another example
# of code that will be interpreted as dead by vulture is anything that
# is used in a template (which is not considered in the analysis).
#
# Therefore, the results of this script should be used as a jumping off
# point for investigating potential dead code removal
