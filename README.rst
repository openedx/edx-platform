Purpose
*******
The `Open edX Platform <https://openedx.org>`_ is a service-oriented platform for authoring and
delivering online learning at any scale.  The platform is written in
Python and JavaScript and makes extensive use of the Django
framework. At the highest level, the platform is composed of a
monolith, some independently deployable applications (IDAs), and
micro-frontends (MFEs) based on the ReactJS.

This repository hosts the monolith at the center of the Open edX
platform.  Functionally, the edx-platform repository provides two services:

* CMS (Content Management Service), which powers Open edX Studio, the platform's learning content authoring environment; and
* LMS (Learning Management Service), which delivers learning content.

Documentation
*************

Documentation can be found at https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform.

Getting Started
***************

For Production
==============

Installing and running an Open edX instance is not simple.  We strongly
recommend that you use a service provider to run the software for you.  They
have free trials that make it easy to get started:
https://openedx.org/get-started/

However, if you have the time and expertise, then it is is possible to
self-manage a production Open edX instance. To help you build, customize,
upgrade, and scale your instance, we recommend using `Tutor`_, the
community-supported, Docker-based Open edX distribution.

You can read more about getting up and running with a Tutor deployment
at the `Site Ops home on docs.openedx.org`_.

For Development
===============

Tutor also features a `development mode`_ which will also help you modify,
test, and extend edx-platform. We recommend this method for all Open edX
developers.

Bare Metal (Advanced)
=====================

It is also possible to spin up an Open edX platform directly on a Linux host.
This method is less common and mostly undocumented. The Open edX community will
only be able to provided limited support for it.

Running "bare metal" is only advisable for (a) developers seeking an
adventure and (b) experienced system administrators who are willing to take the
complexity of Open edX configuration and deployment into their own hands.

System Dependencies
-------------------

Interperters/Tools:

* Python 3.11

* Node 18

Services:

* MySQL 8.0

* Mongo 7.x

* Memcached

Language Packages:

* Frontend:

  - ``npm clean-install`` (production)
  - ``npm clean-install --dev`` (development)

* Backend build:

  - ``pip install -r requirements/edx/assets.txt``

* Backend application:

  - ``pip install -r requirements/edx/base.txt`` (production)
  - ``pip install -r requirements/edx/dev.txt`` (development)

Build Steps
-----------

Create two MySQL databases and a MySQL user with write permissions to both, and configure
Django to use them by updating the ``DATABASES`` setting.

Then, run migrations::

  ./manage.py lms migrate
  ./manage.py lms migrate --database=student_module_history
  ./manage.py cms migrate

Build static assets (for more details, see `building static
assets`_)::

  npm run build  # or, 'build-dev'

Download locales and collect static assets (can be skipped for development
sites)::

  make pull_translations
  ./manage.py lms collectstatic
  ./manage.py cms collectstatic

Set up CMS SSO (for Development)::

  ./manage.py lms manage_user studio_worker example@example.com --unusable-password
  # DO NOT DO THIS IN PRODUCTION. It will make your auth insecure.
  ./manage.py lms create_dot_application studio-sso-id studio_worker \
      --grant-type authorization-code \
      --skip-authorization \
      --redirect-uris 'http://localhost:18010/complete/edx-oauth2/' \
      --scopes user_id  \
      --client-id 'studio-sso-id' \
      --client-secret 'studio-sso-secret'

Set up CMS SSO (for Production):

* Create the CMS user and the OAuth application::

    ./manage.py lms manage_user studio_worker <email@yourcompany.com> --unusable-password
    ./manage.py lms create_dot_application studio-sso-id studio_worker \
        --grant-type authorization-code \
        --skip-authorization \
        --redirect-uris 'http://localhost:18010/complete/edx-oauth2/' \
        --scopes user_id

* Log into Django admin (eg. http://localhost:18000/admin/oauth2_provider/application/),
  click into the application you created above (``studio-sso-id``), and copy its "Client secret".
* In your private LMS_CFG yaml file or your private Django settings module:

 * Set ``SOCIAL_AUTH_EDX_OAUTH2_KEY`` to the client ID (``studio-sso-id``).
 * Set ``SOCIAL_AUTH_EDX_OAUTH2_SECRET`` to the client secret (which you copied).
Run the Platform
----------------

First, ensure MySQL, Mongo, and Memcached are running.

Start the LMS::

  ./manage.py lms runserver 18000

Start the CMS::

  ./manage.py cms runserver 18010

This will give you a mostly-headless Open edX platform. Most frontends have
been migrated to "Micro-Frontends (MFEs)" which need to be installed and run
separately. At a bare minimum, you will need to run the `Authentication MFE`_,
`Learner Home MFE`_, and `Learning MFE`_ in order meaningfully navigate the UI.
