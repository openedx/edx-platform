Documentation
-------------

Documentation is managed in the `edx-documentation`_ repository. Documentation
is built using `Sphinx`_: you can `view the built documentation on
ReadTheDocs`_.

You can also check out `Confluence`_, our wiki system. Once you sign up for
an account, you'll be able to create new pages and edit existing pages, just
like in any other wiki system. You only need one account for both Confluence
and `JIRA`_, our issue tracker.
