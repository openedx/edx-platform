This is the core repository of the Open edX software. It includes the LMS
(student-facing, delivering courseware), and Studio (course authoring)
components.

Installation
------------

Installing and running an Open edX instance is not simple.  We strongly
recommend that you use a service provider to run the software for you.  They
have free trials that make it easy to get started:
https://openedx.org/get-started/

If you will be modifying edx-platform code, the `Open edX Developer Stack`_ is
a Docker-based development environment.

If you want to run your own Open edX server and have the technical skills to do
so, `Open edX Installation Options`_ explains your options.
